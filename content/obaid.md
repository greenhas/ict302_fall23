# About myself: 

Greetings from the world of technology and cultural exploration! I am Baidullah Hazrat, but you can call me Obaid. As an international transfer student and a senior majoring in ICT (Information and Communication Technology) here at the University of Kentucky. Let’s get to the fun part, where you will be able to learn about me and what I love to do.

# Get To Know Me: 

Curious about the face behind the blog? Here's a glimpse into my world:
Academic Journey: I am currently a senior pursuing my degree in ICT, bringing a blend of academic knowledge and real-world tech experiences to the table.
Multilingual Explorer: With a love for languages, I speak six of them fluently. It is not just about communication; it is about connecting with people from various corners of the globe.
Cue Sports Enthusiast: When I am not immersed in the digital realm, you will likely find me at the billiards table, showcasing my snooker skills or adapting to the game of billiards – a bridge to my love for diversity and new experiences.
