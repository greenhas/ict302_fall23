### About Me
Hello! My name is Douglas Loia and I am 19 year old from San Jose California and I currently attend the University of Kentucky with a major of Information Communication Technology.

Hobbies Outside of the Classroom
Passion for Basketball

Beyond the digital realm, I find solace on the basketball court. This sport not only keeps me physically active but also instills invaluable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Whether in friendly matches or intense competitions, the court is where I refine not only my skills, but also my character.

Admiration for Automobiles

When I'm not in the digital world, you'll often find me immersed in my love for cars. It's not just about the horsepower and high-speed thrills (although those are pretty great), but also the artistry that goes into their design. From the growl of a powerful engine to the sleek lines of a well-crafted chassis, cars are a symphony of engineering and style.
