***Private Life***:
Keenan Rhodes is a 23-year old undergraduate student in the College of Communication at the University of Kentucky. He lives with his wife Morgan, who also attends the University of Kentucky, and their pet dog, Pepper, who is the most adorable canine anyone will ever meet.

***Work Ethic***:
Keenan was taught at a young age to always complete tasks to the best of his ability. With this value being a vital part of how he sees himself, he puts extreme effort into any project or discussion that comes his way. A common term that is used to describe people such as this is a perfectionist.
