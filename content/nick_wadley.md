## Biography
Hello everyone, my name is Nick Wadley, and I am a student at the University of Kentucky! I am a sophomore with a major in Information Communication Technology. Aside from that, I grew up in Kennesaw, Georgia, and I used to play basketball in high school (LeBron James is the GOAT in my opinion). Some of my hobbies include recreational pickleball, playing video games, and watching sports on the weekends. My favorite restaurant is Chick-fil-A, but I can never turn down some good Panera Bread! Overall, I am a fun person who loves trying new things and has a diverse set of hobbies!

## Career Goal
The main goal I have for my career is to work for Amazon Web Services with my brother. More specifically, I want to be a part of the Cloud Computing Services department, which is where he works. Marquis (my brother) was the main reason for choosing my major in college, which is Information Communication Technology. Therefore, I want to learn as much as I can about cloud computing so we can be work partners one day. That would truly be a dream come true.
