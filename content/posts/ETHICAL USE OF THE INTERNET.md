# ETHICAL USE OF THE INTERNET:Responsibly and Consciously Navigating the Web.  

# Intro: 

The internet changed the world to a general community, connecting people and facilitating access to information and resources. But this powerful tool also brings up ethics and morality in debate. This blog post will explore the ethical use of technology, debating responsible actions and how can every user contribute for a safer and more responsible online world. In this context, privacy is incredibly important to be discussed since it is one of the pillars of ethical usage of the Web. In a world where our sensitive data and privacy could be leaked and used in such evil ways, data privacy and protection became one of the biggest topics when it comes to technology. This made users re-think on where, why and if it is a good idea to share any sort of personal data online. It is not online about respecting the law on internet justice but also knowing how to act respectfully towards others online. Using the internet ethically also means being honest and transparent, talking more about morals and personal value than the actual law. Being honest is essential, not only online but life in general, from listing products online all the way to providing accurate information and not disseminating false information. 

Furthermore, the conscious use of the web implies being responsible for your own actions.  Every post made; every comment posted has complete power to hurt someone. So, it is essential to be conscious and adopt a social responsibility posture towards others while using the web. The internet is a mirror that reflects society, revealing not only the benefits society gained from it but also all the ethical pillars that need to be filled. Challenges such as pirating (illegal streaming) and copyrighting are clear examples of how online actions can have ethical and legal impacts. The download and dissemination of copyrighted content is not online illegal but at the same time disrespectful towards the person and its creative to come up with the piece of entertainment in question. 

Cyberbullying and online harassment are another terrible examples of how bad of a turn internet usage can take and how evilly someone can take advantage of the internet of. The fact you can hide your face and post from far away give criminals the false sensation of immunity to the law, taking them to perform acts that would cost them a long time behind bars if performed in ‘real life.’ Fighting those criminals is not only a matter of enforcing the law but also a matter of cleaning the online space form bad people to create a healthy and peaceful digital environment. The key to achieving those goals might be what us called “web education” where people physically take time to teach the youths about basically everything that was discussed here. Like we teach kids how to cross the street, we should teach our kids on how to navigate on the web safely and respectfully so throughout life, the nowadays kids won’t become either the victim or the aggressor.
Laws, terms, conditions, and instructions on how to properly surf the web play an important role as moderators of the internet. But the real change comes from every individual. We as users of the internet detain the power to start a change and be ethical and disseminate respect online every day, every post. Like this blog post has the power to change millions of minds, to incentive people to talk about it and spread that the ethical use of technology is one of the most important topics of today’s society. Making ourselves as role models. 
To summarize and conclude the analytics part of the post, I would say the ethical usage of technology is a shared responsibility among users, government agencies, communities, and all individuals. It is continuous dedication to create a digital environment that reflects the best aspects of humanity. As we dedicate to take care of the planet, we should also dedicate on how to leave behind a clean digital footprint, promoting honesty, responsibility, and respect. The internet is defined by its users and what they use it for. Throughout conscious and ethical actions, we can guarantee that the internet, at the end of the day, will have more positive than negative effects on society. 

# The dual nature of the internet:

Potential to a good influence on the planet:

Bringing people together, connecting people all over the world, facilitating access to information, breaking social and economic lines. 
Potential to bad influence on the planet:

Cyberbullying, online harassment, pirating (or online illegal streaming), copyright violations, defamation, hate speech etc. 
Principles of the digital ethics: 

Privacy respect: private information is protected by law and should be kept private for the good of all web users. Exposing someone’s private information can cause unimaginable effects on that person’s life. 

Online Integrity: While sharing information, news or even your personal opinion, being truthful and honest is a must to keep everybody informed of actual data and statists and not made-up stories to convince people while misinformation is spread and disseminated. 
Responsibility: It is important to remember that every post made online can changer someone’s life. You never know what the person on the other side of the screen is going through so being responsible and thoughtful is a must. 

# Legal and Ethical Challenges:

Pirating and Copyright: Illegally sharing protected content is another problem in today’s online world. It is not only illegal but also disrespectful towards the artist, can make business and people lose a lot of money, it is also tax evasion. There is a lot of legal consequences related to illegal streaming and sharing. Those consequences come along with moral and ethics.

Cyberbullying and Online Harassment: Cyberbullying increases suicide attempts by 8.7 percentage points. Cyberbullying increases suicidal thoughts by 15 percentage points. A 1% drop in cyberbullying decreases fatal suicide rates by 11 per every 100,000 individuals. The act of purposely trying to destroy someone’s life online can also destroy their real lives, leading to suicide and self-harm. This activity is illegal, can be charged as multiple crimes and even lead to life in jail with no possibility of parole. This is the most disgusting act of internet ethics violation. 

# Promoting ethical usage of technology:

Digital Education: Again, teaching people, especially the youth, on how to use the internet can prevent individuals from being both the victim and the criminal. Not being the one distributing pirating or consuming it, as an example. 

Law and Regimentations: the Federal Government plays an important role on creating a safe web environment. Creating agencies to patrol the web and regulate it and laws to punish online offenders help create a safe environment, like in person (“real life”) as we need laws and the Police to keep criminals off the streets.  

# Conclusion:

This blog post focused on disserting about Ethical usage of Technology, mainly the internet. This is a clear ICT problem and Information Technicians (as us) detain all the power to provide a lot of changes described in this blog post. We already know a lot of problems listed in here, but we also already learned tools to solve them.
