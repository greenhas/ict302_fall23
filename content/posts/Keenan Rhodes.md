# Introduction

The intended goal of this article is to inform and educate the audience on the potential applications and a few of the key limitations of current AI programs. The article also emphasizes self improvement by attempting to persuade the audience to integrate smart machines into daily tasks to improve quality of life and professional performance. The main argument of this article is that individuals should not fight the progression of technology, but instead should use the technologies that can do a job better than a human being to make the tasks more efficient and streamlined.
	The article concludes by telling the audience that what human beings have to offer that advanced technologies cannot is the ability to relate to others, to show understanding, to listen to others, and to nurture human connections.

	The topic is framed as an informative/argumentative article that uses the limitations of human beings and the biases they often possess to promote the feasibility of using technology to more efficiently handle tasks and handle matters of importance without human interaction.
	It seems strange that most of the article is framed as a way of promoting the use of technologies and the possible applications of them, and in the last section switches to an informative and motivational statement that advocates improving emotional intelligence to stay relevant in the working field by recognizing your weaknesses and turning them into strengths.

	The information included in this article is mostly focused on the rapid development of AI in the ICT field and how the development and improvement of an individual's emotional intelligence and social skills is the best way to relate to others and remain vital in your field of work. It provides many examples of activities and jobs that, with the application of an AI, would be performed more efficiently than if it were done by a human being. The article ends by describing many of the ways that people can continue to improve their emotional intelligence so that they can perform the jobs and tasks that AI programs cannot. 
	The article excludes information pertaining to the downsides of AI technology, besides the inability to emotionally relate to others. Mention of other downsides is not present in the article, downsides such as configuration on the network, necessary maintenance, upkeep, etc. Mention of these downsides would be useful is further persuading newcomers to continue down the ICT work path.

	The language used by the author takes a professional tone without using grandiose language or professional jargon, which allows for a potentially broader audience into those who are just beginning in the ICT field and professionals who have “been around the block.”

	There is not a large quantity of evidence provided within the article. Most of the information is the professional opinion of the authors, a recognized digital researcher and the CEO of a machine learning company. The quality of the external resource links could also be questioned, most of the resources linked in the article go to various example websites that do not provide more context or details for the ideas presented.
