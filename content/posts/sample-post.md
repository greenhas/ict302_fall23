# randomly generated text from Star Trek's Commander Riker

Well, that's certainly good to know. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! They were just sucked into space. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Sorry, Data. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you.Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Travel time to the nearest starbase? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. I'll alert the crew. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers?
