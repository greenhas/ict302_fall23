I chose to analyze Danielle Citron’s ted talk titled “How deep fakes undermine truth and
threaten democracy”. This speech highlights the stories around the world that showcase the
worst aspects of deepfake technology. She speaks on the story of a Journalist, Rana Ayyub, in
India that speaks out against government corruption who had her image used for deep fake
pornography. This was done to defame her reputation both as a journalist and muslim woman.
Rana now suffers from anxiety and she is specifically terrified of strangers taking photos of her.
Cirton then describes deep fakes in detail and how they are one one face typically placed over
the faces of actors in pornography or other videos. Citron gives a perfect amount of detail in
regards to how deep fakes are created and instead focuses on the impacts their creation has
had. She goes on to state what impact deep fakes can have on things such as elections or trust
in public figures. The speaker includes a portion describing “the liars dividend” or the claim that
true evidence is in fact falsefied. This is crucial to understanding how deepfakes can cause
widespread issues. The verification of truth is fundamental to so many aspects of life including
our justice system. Citron touches on this including the lack of legislation that is currently in
place to protect against depfakes. She highlights the education of those in law enforcement as
well as the average user on how to detect deepfakes is crucial to protecting against
misinformation. This is a very prominent idea which I have seen recently in research
surrounding this topic. Many claim that with the rapid increase in deepfake technology that the
only true defense is through the general public’s knowledge of deepfakes and their uses.I
believe Danielle Citron did an excellent job of contextualizing the issues that deep fakes are
causing alongside a call for others to take this issue with the seriousness it deserves.


Danielle Citron co-authored one of the primary papers defining and documenting this
phenomenon when it comes to political figures. She co-authored the aforementioned “Deep
Fakes: A Looming Challenge for Privacy, Democracy, and National Security”. She is very
knowledgeable on the topic of deep fakes and deep fake litigation. She states that she has been
drafting bills in multiple states which tackle the deepfake issue.. In my research, I have come
across her name and work referenced in many other articles and journals on this topic. This talk
offers a detailed look into what deepfakes are and why they pose such a significant threat to the
marketplace of ideas. She also calls for international laws to be put in place to ensure the safety
of users online. The creators of deep fakes without consent should be held accountable
regardless of their home country. Danielle summarized and brought attention to the issues
surrounding deep fakes and the lack of recourse many women have due to current laws.
