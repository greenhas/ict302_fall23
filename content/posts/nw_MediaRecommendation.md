**Hey guys!** It’s your boy Nick back at it with his last blog of 2023. I know you all are disappointed by that statement, but it hurts me just as much as it hurts you. Moving on (*LOL*), for this blog post, I will discuss the TED talk “[How Businesses Are Easing Us into Facial Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pMlf3MVfTc)” by Parmy Olson. 
- First, I will analyze her speech as an informational source and contextualize it based on my knowledge of the technology and how it relates to businesses. 
- Then, I will talk about Olson and see if she is a credible source for this topic. 
- Finally, there will be a section telling you guys about how this piece of media relates to the subject. I saved the best for last here, so it will be a good one! (***I need five stars on Yelp!***)

*"How Businesses Are Easing Us into Facial Recognition"*

*Analyzation/Contextualization* -

Olson’s TED Talk is a great source of information on how businesses have utilized FRT. For starters, she provides the audience with a visual description of how the technology works (Olson, 2020). Based on my knowledge, the picture she utilized is accurate because FRTs analyze someone’s facial structure and then compare it within a database. A bit later in her speech, Olson puts the technology in a business context when discussing how the technology can be used for analytical purposes. She goes on to say how companies like Amazon have implemented programs (Amazon Rekognition, in this case) that not only recognize people’s faces, but can also describe personal characteristics like gender, age, and someone’s emotional state (Olson, 2020). This is an excellent piece of information for people wanting to know how big corporations utilize FRT because it gives them an insight into what programs could be installed into cameras, as well as understand the best ways to protect your privacy as the technology continues to improve. For context, if a hacker saw that you were a kid (despite looking like an adult), your life could potentially be ruined because children are more vulnerable. This is especially troubling considering the potential for stalking is a big downside of FRT (Ahmed, 2022). 

 However, it is important to note that facial recognition technology can be useful in an accountability context. This is something Olson highlighted when she talked about how Uber drivers must take a picture every few months to verify their identity (Olson, 2020). Once again, we see how the technology is used within a business setting, while it also keeps employees in check. Clearly, Olson’s TED Talk is a great information source when looking at technology within a business context. Now, let’s see how credible the speaker is.

*Credibility Analysis* -

The speaker of the TED Talk, Parmy Olson, is a technological reporter for the Wall Street Journal (Olson, 2020). While the occupation itself technically does not make her credible because technology is so broad, her involvement in the issue (how businesses use FRT) grants her ethos. For instance, she shows the audience how she tested out BetaFace’s FRT system and the numerous descriptions it displayed to her. She also emphasized how it identified her as white, which leads to her point about how several companies use FRT to track ethnicities (Olson, 2020). That personal experience establishes ethos because it illustrates how she has encountered facial analytics (and FRT as a whole), along with the fact that she had to interview companies (i.e., Budgens) to further analyze how the technology is used within a business context. Olson also mentions a lot of companies’ FRT systems scan for ethnicity (Olson, 2020). The latter fact is ironic, however, because of how bad they are at recognizing a minority’s face. Now that the speaker’s credibility has been established, let’s see how this speech relates to corporate use of facial recognition technology.

*The Connection* -

This TED Talk can be a great launching point for people wanting to know how facial recognition technology relates to businesses because it gives them an introduction to the topic. People who are interested can delve into further research regarding the topic and can even watch similar talks. Also, companies who watch Olson’s speech might think about incorporating facial analytics into their systems and upgrading their basic FRT. It is wonderful to think about the impact this talk can have on the relationship between corporations and facial recognition technology.

With that, I’m out everyone! I hope you all enjoyed my blogs this year, and I hope to continue making more in the future. Don’t miss me too much lol. Anyways, this is Nick Wadley, **signing out**.
