***Introduction***

Hey guys, this week I decided to look into an article published on astronomy.com on August 9th, 2023. The article’s title is Starlink satellites are disrupting cosmic studies by Elizabeth Gamillo. To start, the first thing I wanted to look at was, who is this author? What is her motivation for writing this article? On Astronomy.com’s website you can view all the articles posted by a particular author so I decided to look at her past articles. It seems like she writes articles specifically about space discovery. With articles titled Mystery of strobing pulsar may be solved, XRISM X-ray telescope launches this week to study the chaotic universe, Astronomers find a brown dwarf that’s hotter than the Sun and many more like those, she is certainly very interested in space and what it has to offer. There are two images in the article. One is an image from the perspective of one of Starlink’s satellites looking down at earth, and the other is according to the caption “an artist’s impression of a large satellite constellation in low Earth orbit circling the LOFAR telescope” showing satellites in a cross hatching pattern across the night sky. The tone of this article is clear from the title, it is going to serve as a warning to fellow astronomers that Starlink is causing issues for their study. 

***Article Analysis***

The article starts by citing a study published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, a peer-reviewed journal that specializes in its namesake. The study claims that when observing 68 of Starlink’s satellites, they detected electromagnetic radiation that originated from the satellites onboard electronics. Later in the article they bring up the significance of this radiation. A large part of astronomy is using radio telescopes to observe distant objects in outer space that produce electromagnetic radiation to produce pictures that we can’t see with our eyes. The problem they are bringing up is that the close satellites are radiating along the same frequencies they are using to scan and are disrupting the images the telescope is trying to get. Gamillo got a quote from one of the Study authors, Di Vruno, saying that “it is like being in a dark room when, suddenly, someone lights a torch near your eyes.”You are just suddenly blind, and you don’t see anything. That’s a similar situation.”” SpaceX has come to an agreement though, where they limit interference from their satellites around a specific frequency in which astronomers can  work around. Astronomers are worried though as more and more satellites go into orbit, there will be more radiation leaking and they won’t have any frequency that they can work with. SpaceX isn’t the only satellite constellation going up, another satellite constellation owned by OneWeb, is also launching satellites and as of the time of the article has 648 satellites already up there.

*Audience Analysis*: 
The article is clearly geared toward fellow astronomers and others who enjoy stargazing. This is expected though due to the article being on astronomy.com and that being its intended audience. The wording of the article is also something to look at. Whenever referencing the satellite constellations, Gamillo uses wording like “vast fleet of Starlink satellites” and “swarm of satellite constellations”. This is to portray their massive size to the readers and to make the problem of their frequency radiation seem bigger. Another thing Gamillo does with their wording is that when they reference celestial bodies and events, they use wondrous descriptive wording like “Countless objects in space radiate different forms of light on the electromagnetic spectrum. Throughout space, electromagnetic waves travel like ripples moving through water. Distant galaxies, vibrant nebulae, and radio bursts from planets all emit forms of electromagnetic radiation that experts tune into with radio telescopes and amplify to get the full picture of what we can’t see with our eyes.”. This wording has a kind of romanticizing effect on its subject of space that can persuade readers to take the side of the author. By alluding to space being so beautiful and the satellites being a swarm they influence the audience that space needs to be protected from these “swarms of insects”-like satellites that are ruining its beauty. 

*Conclusion*: 
To sum the article up, Gamillo is writing a persuasive piece to convince the scientific community to begin speaking up to their governments. The main goal of this article is to get the ball rolling for regulatory bodies to put regulations in place for the area around the planet. Since it’s a new problem there isn’t much regulation for this sort of thing out there currently and the astronomy community is already having problems with it right now, who knows how much it will affect them when there are over 42,000 satellites up there. This is a problem that we are going to have to solve one way or another in the near future. In my opinion, we should move towards more telescopes in space. The images we get from the satellites up there already like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb Space Telescope and other deep space telescopes give us way more information than we are able to get from down on the surface of Earth anyway. With more telescopes up in space they don’t have to worry about interference with satellites and light pollution from nearby cities like they do down here. I know it may be expensive to construct and place those up in space but it is a necessary step in our future because Starlink and similar services are a major part of the future of the internet and connectivity on Earth.
