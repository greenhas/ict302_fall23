[What if our data could be protected online?](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_banta_what_if_our_data_could_be_protected_online)

I chose a TED talk titled *'What if our data could be protected online?'*. The speaker in this video, Derek Banta, has worked at UPS for over 20 years, working in a variety of roles, most recently Director of Concepts in the global product innovation group. What Derek speaks about in his presentation is taking our privacy back by shifting from an e-commerce world to an anonymous commerce world. He suggests that users should give their information to a single trusted third party, who secures your information and gives you a keycode to conduct business and shop anonymously. In this scenario, the retailer would only see your private avatar and see none of your personal data. Meanwhile, the third-party anonymous commerce provider would be solely focused on protecting users’ personal data from anything ranging from small nuisances like targeted advertising, to serious threats like identity theft. And in the event that this third party gets hacked, Derek says the hackers wouldn’t be able to see thousands of transactions linked to personal data, only seeing one record at a time, making the return on a hack far less useful for the hackers. 

I like the idea Derek has here, but I question if it can really be implemented. To completely shift away from e-commerce and towards anonymous commerce, not only would a majority of consumers need to step away from e-commerce and online shopping, but all of the online stores would have to implement a way to accept this third party keycode as a form of payment. Also, while they would no longer have access to consumers’ personal information, access might be something they enjoy having and want to keep. Perhaps if enough people stopped online shopping boycott style, change could be forced upon them. However, I don’t see that as something likely to happen. 

Because of his role at UPS, Derek has been allowed to witness the frontlines of innovation. Many different brilliant ideas are presented to his company, finding ways to use company information to sell more and better target customers. Because of this position and these experiences, I’d say he’s a credible source to speak about personal data and information. When none of the companies coming to UPS were proposing ways to protect their consumers’ right to privacy. This is when he came up with the idea for anonymous commerce as a way to protect that right to privacy. Because of this, I also think he’s qualified to speak about data privacy and protecting individuals’ personal information.  

This TED Talk can help people with protecting their personal information online. In the video Derek states that we should move away from e-commerce and move towards anonymous commerce. While anonymous commerce might only be a concept currently, people moving away from online commerce could aid them in protecting their personal information by providing fewer opportunities for the personal information to be available to view and possibly leak or use for nefarious purposes. It could also get the ball rolling on potential other ways to protect personal information. Someone could make an attempt at creating anonymous commerce through a third-party provider, or a fresh idea could be had and a product or method created to protect consumers and their personal data.
