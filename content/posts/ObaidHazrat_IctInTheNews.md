# News Brief

[Article link](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/today-uk-parliament-undermined-privacy-security-and-freedom-all-internet-users) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of speech is important because it supports individual expression, encourages a diversity of viewpoints, and encourages democratic discussion. It is also crucial online because it upholds these values in the digital age and enables open discussion, information sharing, and global connectivity. The government is crucial in protecting users' rights and safety online, in addition to promoting individual speech and a diversity of perspectives. While the right to free speech is a cornerstone of democracy, governments also have a duty to safeguard their people from harm and keep the internet a secure environment. It can be difficult to strike the correct balance between these goals, therefore governments frequently pass laws and rules to address problems like cyberbullying, hate speech, and the spread of harmful content while upholding the principles of free expression. By doing this, they hope to foster an online community where people may interact freely and exchange information without risking their safety or wellbeing. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article for the news brief I chose is from the UK, stating that the UK parliament has passed the Online Safety Bill (OSB), that aims to make the internet safer. However, the article contends that the measure might have detrimental effects on online freedom, security, and privacy. The OSB contains a provision that permits the government to order tech companies to examine all user content for child abuse, even if it is end-to-end encrypted. This might result in the development of encryption backdoors, jeopardizing user security and privacy. Concerns regarding censorship are also raised in the article since online platforms would be required to remove content judged improper for minors, which may result in politicized censorship choices. Furthermore, age-verification technologies can violate the ideals of anonymous and uncomplicated internet use. The OSB is highly opposed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which emphasizes the significance of preserving internet privacy and security as basic human rights. (Mullin, 2023). The article concludes by noting that encrypted messaging services may withdraw from the UK if the government compromises their ability to protect users' privacy. 

The potential breach of online privacy, security, and freedom caused by the UK Parliament's passage of the Online Safety Bill (OSB) is the ICT policy concern raised in the article. The following policy problems are highlighted in the article: 

1. Encryption Backdoors: The article underlines the worry that the OSB could result in the development of encryption backdoors, which would jeopardize internet users' privacy and security. Because it concerns the government's involvement in regulating encryption technology and its possible effects on user data protection, this is a key ICT policy issue. 

2. Government-imposed online content filtering is a worry raised by the OSB's measures for content removal, particularly for material judged improper for children.  

This policy issue involves the government's authority to regulate and potentially restrict online speech and expression. 

3. Age-Verification Systems: The article raises issues with age-verification systems that might interfere with anonymous and straightforward internet use. The balance between safeguarding children’s online privacy rights and defending adults' right to free speech is at stake in this policy debate. 

With an emphasis on the potential effects of the OSB's regulations, the article highlights the complicated ICT policy concerns surrounding online safety, privacy, and freedom in the digital age. 

Various stakeholders, including primary, secondary, and essential stakeholders, are mentioned in the article on the UK's Online Safety Bill (OSB). The analysis of these stakeholders is as follows: 

#### Primary Stakeholders:  

1. UK Government: As the body in charge of creating, approving, and putting into effect the Online Safety Bill, the UK government is a key stakeholder. The main goal of the government is to make sure that its citizens, particularly kids, are safe online. 

#### Secondary Stakeholders: 

1. Privacy Advocacy Groups: The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a group that was mentioned in the article, is an example of a secondary stakeholder. They support internet freedom, privacy, and digital rights. They are concerned about the OSB's potential violation of these rights. 

2. Children Safety Advocacy Groups: These organizations work to promote children’s safety and protection online. They are in favor of the bill's goal of eradicating child abuse content, but they could be worried about unforeseen implications as well. 

#### Key Stakeholders: 

1. Children and Parents: Since the bill intends to protect children online, children and their parents are important stakeholders. They have a clear stake in how well the bill ensures a secure internet environment.  

These are the stakeholders that the article itself displayed. However, regarding the Online Safety Bill and its potential effects, each group has interests and worries. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the internet Safety Bill (OSB), the UK is tackling the issue of internet safety, particularly regarding safeguarding children from inappropriate content and identifying child abuse materials. The OSB is an example of how the government is attempting to control and enhance internet safety, but it has also generated concerns about how it can affect online privacy and free speech. There is now no significant opposition to the bill itself because it is a new law that will soon affect UK citizens. However, as the article itself noted, the problem is that it can in some way conflict with the user's right to free speech. 

### 1. Existing US Law and Policy: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act: In the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has been a key legal provision governing online platforms (DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE’S REVIEW OF SECTION 230 OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT OF 1996, 2021). It generally shields online platforms from legal liability for content posted by users while allowing them to moderate content as they see fit. Additionally, the first amendment and the fourth amendment in the US do not allow such laws to pass that contradict these amendments. The first amendment serves that everyone has their own voice and can express their voice. The same way the fourth amendment also serves as a tool that no one can search/seizure without any warrant, which is what the article talked about.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA): The US has laws like COPPA that specifically target the protection of children online. COPPA requires websites and online services directed towards children under 13 to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information (Children’s Privacy, n.d.).  

Self-Regulation: The US has traditionally relied on self-regulation by online platforms. Companies often have their content policies and moderation mechanisms to address harmful or inappropriate content. 

Federal Trade Commission (FTC): The FTC plays a role in enforcing online privacy regulations and can act against companies that violate consumer privacy laws. 

### 2. Existing Solutions in the US: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online Content Moderation: Online platforms in the US, like social media companies, have their content moderation policies and mechanisms to address issues such as hate speech, harassment, and harmful content (Online Hate and Harassment: The American Experience 2023 | ADL, 2023). International Cooperation: The US often cooperates with other countries and international organizations to combat issues like child exploitation and terrorism online. This involves sharing information and resources to address cross-border challenges. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the class module, in week 6 we studied privacy laws in the US. It clearly states that privacy is essential for businesses to grow, while states like California have enacted a privacy law for its citizens, the state law is still under question and is yet to act (Violino, 2022). In the same week, we studied about a new law passed in San Fransico where the police can watch security cameras of anyone. While some people liked the law others were concerned about their privacy (Chen, 2022).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the UK's Online Safety Bill serves as a sobering reminder of the complex and dynamic interactions that exist in our digital age between online safety, personal privacy, and the freedom of speech. This complex problem has resonance outside of the UK because it highlights a problem that affects governments, tech corporations, and people all over the world. The balance between protecting online spaces and respecting individual liberties is still a matter of policy discussion in the United States, where online platforms have historically depended on a combination of self-regulation and existing regulations like Section 230 and COPPA. This continuous conversation highlights the urgent need for a balanced strategy—one that safeguards people's safety, especially that of vulnerable populations like children, while respecting the fundamental ideals of privacy and freedom of expression that
