# Introduction
  Anxiety and depression are becoming more common among children. A study done by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows that with children aged 3-17, anxiety has increased by 29% and depression has increased by 27% (ASPA 2022). What has caused this drastic increase in mental health diagnoses in such a short period of time? Well, there are many possible factors, but the one I’d like to focus on is social media. Specifically, TikTok. TikTok has quickly become one of, if not the most popular social media platforms because of its appeal to the younger generation, and its sophisticated algorithm that, from experience, lures people in for hours. TikTok isn’t inherently bad, but its ability to hyperfocus on what you enjoy can easily lead to issues down the road. 

# How TikTok's Algorithm Works
  There are four main components TikTok uses to determine what to put on your For You page next: engagement, interactions, information about the video, and your settings (“How to Work With the TikTok Algorithm in 2023”). I’d like to break each one of these components down and talk about how TikTok uses them. 

1. **Engagement** – If you like and comment on a video, similar videos are sure to follow until you stop liking and commenting on that type of video. Even if you are more passive and do not like or comment on videos, other factors such as viewer retention play a role in which video is up next For You to enjoy. If you watch an entire video, TikTok is going to note that and show you more videos that are similar. If you quickly scroll past a video, TikTok will make a note of that and stop showing you those kinds of videos. I decided to try this out myself. I was getting a lot of videos that would share stories from Reddit (another social media site) while playing some other video alongside it on my For You page. I wanted this to stop because I was getting tired of these videos. So anytime I saw one, I immediately scrolled past it to let TikTok know I was tired of these kinds of videos. Sure enough, in maybe half an hour I noticed that I was receiving an entirely new set of content from TikTok, and I was enjoying it. So not only did TikTok pick up what I no longer liked, but it also had a backup plan for when what I used to enjoy watching started to fail. 
2. **Interactions** – This component is not as sophisticated as engagement, but the people you follow, and the people they follow play a role in what you see as well. This makes sense because you obviously should like the content of the people you follow, and very well might enjoy someone’s content if someone you enjoy enjoys their content as well.  
3. **Information About the Video** – Even the seemingly minute details play a role in the algorithm. Things like the caption of the video, the tags the creator puts in the caption, and where the video was edited can influence who it reaches. If the video was edited with TikTok, the video might hit a different audience than if it was edited elsewhere. The captions in the videos could determine if you see that video or not. Probably the biggest aspect of the information about the video, however, is the tags creators put on their videos. This allows the creators to sort of group their content with others, which ultimately allows for these creators to gain similar audiences. It is possible for watchers of content to fall into niches and watch similar content provided by different creators. I have done this myself with Wordle TikTok creators. I would see one do the Wordle for the day, scroll, and see someone else do the exact same thing to see if that creator got it as well. This may not always be the case, but it is something that is noteworthy.  
4. **Settings** – This component may be a bit more obvious, but things such as the language you speak, the place you live, and your age are going to change what you see on TikTok. If you do not speak Spanish, there is almost no reason why you should be seeing videos that are in Spanish. If you are 30 years old, even if you think you’re hip and cool, you are more than likely not going to understand or want to see Gen Z content.  

  All of this is to say that TikTok knows what they are doing and will find out what you do and do not enjoy to tailor content towards you. While this may seem like a good thing that will keep you entertained, it might have adverse effects if you are not in a great mental state.  

# The Impact Tik Tok’s Algorithm Has on Viewers 

## **Causation**
   Although more than likely unintentional, social media platforms create a “culture of comparison” in which children compare themselves to others they see on social media (“TikTok and Youth Mental Health” 2023). This can easily lead to children becoming less confident in themselves, wondering why they don’t look a certain way, thinking they need to do whatever they can to try and look better, and other adverse effects on their self-esteem. All of these are unhealthy thoughts, especially for children whose brains are not even close to being fully developed. Unless these thoughts are resolved, these children are more than likely going to experience some form of anxiety, depression, or any other multitude of mental health issues. Outside the culture of comparison, social media can also promote cycles of cyberbullying and social exclusion. Receiving mean comments about oneself is never a fun experience and can be difficult to ignore. On top of that, social media can promote rejection. If someone were to try and follow a friend on TikTok and got denied, they’re going to begin wondering if that friend enjoys them as a person or not. Again, all these negative experiences can easily spiral into some form of mental health issues for anyone experiencing them. 

## **Continuation** 
  As mentioned earlier, TikTok’s algorithm is great at what it does. It will show you videos of similar content until you don’t want it anymore. The issue with that is if you are continuously receiving videos that make you compare yourself to others, you are going to continue to spiral toward poor mental health. On top of that, there are creators out there who recognize that there are people out there who have poor mental health and try to capitalize on that. Here is a **[video]( https://www.tiktok.com/@_mylatenightthoughts_/video/7224762921350581550)** for reference.
This is a clear example of how creators can further push those who are struggling with their mental health down the spiral. And with TikTok’s persistent algorithm, one might find themselves watching hours upon hours of this type of content, making it incredibly difficult to see a way out of the spiral. Additionally, if you were to take a quick scroll through the comments, you would find thousands of others that relate to this type of content. One might see these comments and find some sort of comfort in knowing they’re not the only ones going through this. This makes it even more difficult to find a way out of the spiral because they don’t know what is at the top, but they do know that they are not alone at the bottom. 

# What Can Be Done?
  You probably already know what can be done to help mitigate the impacts of TikTok. Things like reducing screen time, taking breaks, and unfollowing those accounts that post negative things are all said to help improve mental health (The Impact of TikTok on Mental Health and How to Handle It, 2022). But if this is the case, why doesn’t everyone do it? The solutions are said to be simple, yet mental health issues continue to increase year after year. I think these solutions simply do not work. Reducing screen time seems great on paper. You can limit your screen time on TikTok, or for your phone in general. But these rarely work because you can easily bypass the screen time restrictions. TikTok even has ads that ask you if you think you’ve been scrolling for too long, but all you must do is scroll past the ad and that’s it. Taking breaks may help a little, but the underlying cause of mental health issues, TikTok, still exists. Therefore, mental health issues will persist. Blocking negative accounts seems like it may help, but there are so many out there that I’m not sure it would help. Think of spam calls. Sure, you’ll get a break from one number, but there are thousands of others waiting to call you. Completely getting rid of TikTok may seem like a viable option, but then one might feel left out or resort to a different form of social media that might cause the same problems. Something might be able to help, but the answer is not going to be as simple as some people try to make it out to be. 

# Conclusion
  Ultimately, TikTok’s algorithm takes many factors into consideration when showing consumers their next video. It is great at what it does and can keep people entertained for hours. However, because of that, there is a sort of double-edged sword in which one can view content that is detrimental to their mental health for hours and develop mental health issues because of it. With mental health issues in children on the rise, and no sign of TikTok dying anytime soon, what can be done to combat these issues outside of what has already been recommended?
