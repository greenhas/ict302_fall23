# Introduction

This blog is dedicated to the issue of social media usage and its profound impact on the mental health of American society and more specifically my generation, Generation Z. In this flagship post, we will examine the role that social media plays in Gen Z’s health and set sail toward understanding the complex and new phenomenon that is social media, the aspects of social media addiction, the social pressures that it creates, and the benefits of deleting your social media. This blog will provide a thoughtful analysis of evidence-based research and an important discussion of relevant topics that can educate and empower an individual to make informed decisions about their health when it comes to social media usage. Perhaps deleting it all is not the best approach for one, but this blog will provide you with the proper information to make an informed decision and decide what is best for you!

# Definitions

This blog defines the following terms as such:  
  
**Gen Z or Zoomers** is defined by the American Psychological Association as individuals aged 15 to 21 in 2019, which is now anyone ages 19 to 25 in 2023 (Bethune, 2019).  
  
**Mental health** is defined by the CDC as our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Mental health affects how we feel, think, and act (CDC, 2023). 
  
**Social Media** is defined as a collective term for community-based websites and applications that focus on communication, interaction, and content sharing (Lutkevich, 2021).  

# Mental Health in America
Mental health in America is a pressing issue that affects all individuals across a diverse range of backgrounds. For example, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, or NAMI, has expressed that 1 in 5 Americans struggle with mental illness each year (NAMI, 2023). That is around 51 million people. Imagine all of the individuals you interact with daily. Is it more than 5? The odds are that 1 of those individuals has been struggling with some form of mental illness this year. This could include anxiety, depression, and PTSD along with many others. NAMI goes on to state that serious mental illness is experienced by 1 in 20 adults. Do you know 20 people? The odds are that one has experienced a serious mental illness in the past year. This is incredible and does not stop with a simple data point. It moves from a statistic into a real and personal issue when we as friends, family, and Americans recognize this as a serious issue that is affecting great amounts of people and have empathy. For example, these are not simply people who experience mental illness; these are our friends, family, community members, and perhaps ourselves. Let this blog serve as us taking the first steps in educating ourselves toward bettering this issue. 

# Mental Health and Gen Z
The issue of mental health challenges listed above is not exclusive to Gen Z. When it comes to having empathy with a group of individuals experiencing mental illness, it is easier for me, not only as a researcher and student but as a fellow Gen Z member, to focus this blog in the general direction of members of Gen Z. Us Gen Zers were born and raised in the digital age. We are the very first to experience these uniques issues that come with social media technologies, and it is having its effect on us. For example, according to an American Psychological Association feature article, Gen Z is more likely to report mental health concerns, more stressed about issues in the news, and most likely when compared with millennials and Gen Xers to report their mental health as fair or poor (Bethune, 2019).  
  
So let me get this straight… We are the most stressed about issues in the news, we are the most likely to report our mental health as fair or poor, and according to this study, we report experiencing a least one physical emotion because of stress. 
When considering this comparison with other such generations as baby boomers, Gen Xers, millennials, and older adults this is alarming, but I understand that this article is around 4 years old, so let us consider some more current research and see if it gets better. According to a CNN health article around 47% of Gen Zers are thriving in their lives (Shoichet, 2023). This is the lowest among ALL generations in America, and it does not seem to be getting better! I will attribute these negative aspects of mental health and Gen Z to social media content and the amount of time Gen Zers spend on such social media. 

# Social Media Consumption and Mental Health Aspects
I would like you to take a moment and think about how you spend your time. What do you do, where do you go, and with whom do you spend it? Well, I can tell you where we as Gen Z spend our time: on social media!
  
For example, according to a self-report survey from Morning Consult, 38% of Gen Z spend more than 4 hours a day on social media with YouTube and Instagram at the top of the list (Roberts, 2023). That is crazy! That is 1/6th of our day on some form of social media. This excessive use of social media leads to decreases in face-to-face interactions, superficial relationships, and comparison culture. This is dangerous to the health of Gen Z. When social interaction decreases, we miss out on the essence that makes humans social creatures, and this will harm mental health. Just having someone to connect with on an emotional level can make a world of difference to someone's health. It is much harder, if not impossible, to connect with another over social media than face-to-face.
  
This leads me to another aspect of social media that is insane: comparison culture. Social media, like Instagram for example, presents an idealized version of a person and their moments. You know what I am talking about… the photos of nice dinners, parties with friends, pictures of oneself after the gym, travel photos, memorial achievements, etc. I am not saying that someone is wrong for posting this content, but what I will maintain as my goal however is education regarding what consuming this content will do for someone's mental health. 
  
For example, this content is the often doctored best of one's self. Who is gonna post the reality of their life, will it get likes? Humans by nature compare themselves to others. When we are constantly exposed to these curated profiles, we can experience feelings of jealousy and inadequacy which can have profound effects on our mental health.
  
Another aspect of social media consumption that will negatively affect one's health is the time at which it is consumed. For example, in 2019 researchers found that individuals who consume social media before bed go to bed later, sleep less, and obtain lower-quality sleep (Tratakovksy, 2022). This is due to the stimulation the brain receives before bed when it should be winding down. Sleep is the cornerstone of mental and physical well-being, and nothing that someone posts on Instagram is more important than safeguarding one's mental and physical facets. 
  
Finally, and perhaps most disheartening about the use of social media, is its link between depression and anxiety. A 2016 study using survey data from almost 1800 Americans aged 19 to 32 found a link between social media use and increased depression. The researchers do mention that social media may be used with individuals who already suffer from anxiety and depression and perhaps use it as a coping mechanism. Let us recap here: Gen Z has the highest rates of mental illness among all Americans, we report having the lowest levels of leading fulfilled lives, and we also have the highest rates of social media use.
  
With all of these aspects in mind, you may be thinking to yourself, what is the best possible way I might combat this issue of social media having negative aspects on me and my generation? I cannot say for sure as each individual is different, but I know what might help:
  
Deleting it.

# Delete Your Social Media NOW
Alright, perhaps that's a bit much, and perhaps I am being facetious. Social media does offer an awesome outlet for connection with individuals and communities that have never before been possible. Take for example being able to connect with family and friends across the state, country, or even the globe. This is not contested. 
  
What I do contest however is why one needs social media and the legitimacy of that connection. For example, to what benefit does knowing what everyone has going on at all times have to you?  You might say, “Well, I like seeing what X, Y, or Z is up to.” To that  I would respond with, but should you? If you do not interact with these individuals in real life, then should you be able to follow them on social media and know what they are doing all the time? Kinda creepy? 
  
Regarding the legitimacy of the connections formed through social media, take the family or friends example I just used. If you have such a relationship then why can't you connect with them through text or a phone call? Perhaps the most important question I have is what is best for us as users and as humans. I guarantee spending hours on hours a day on social media while foregoing social outings is not the answer to this question. This blog will not only serve as an educational tool for mental health regarding America, Gen Z, and social media, but it will also serve as a platform for open discussions and provide awareness about how to balance the benefits and risks of social media consumption.
