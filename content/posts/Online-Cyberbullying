##Online Cyberbullying
#Whom does it affect?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, mental health treatment became necessary due to cyberbullying in teenagers. So far, my focus of this blog is
how teens are affected by cyberbullying. The purpose of this is to raise awareness that cyber bullying happens to
teens and how it can be mitigated or stopped. The reason that teenagers are targeted for cyberbullying tactics and
online harassment is because they are not cognitively sound, meaning that they are still growing and developing mentally,
and they are very impulsive. Furthermore, cyberbullying happens all the time and it is hard to pinpoint who victimizes
these teenagers.
#What is the topic?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we all know, cyberbullying is a well-known subject matter across any field. It is important to talk about how cyberbullying affects our teenagers. According to Webster’s Dictionary their definition of cyberbullying is different than my own definition, they define cyberbullying to be a mean spirited, hated filled activity that is anonymous which is done through posts that are electronic that does not just target people in general but even more specifically students (Webster, 1996).
#Who is involved?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What typically happens during a cyberbullying situation is the person who is committing the act of cyberbullying has a little bit of protection since they are hiding behind a screen. This affects teenagers in their mental health and in their life overall. Furthermore, those specific teenagers who have experienced cyberbullying may have also experienced depression at higher rates, anxiety at higher rates, loneliness, at a tremendously high rates and suicidal behavior at the highest degree possible (Newport, Academy 2023). Parents should teach their children what the guidelines are for and how to use online safety features to combat cyberbullying
#“Solutions to the issue”
This blog's purpose is to give information on how cyberbullying or online harassment can be avoided or mitigated.  

The most common sites for cyberbullying are Facebook, followed by Twitter, and Snapchat. These include:

1. Texting and messaging apps-The most common app for cyberbullying is text messaging. About half of all teenagers cyberbullied were harassed through text messages.  

2. Messaging online, including Instant messaging and direct messaging- Instant messaging (IM) and direct messaging (DM) are popular ways to cyberbully someone. These apps allow people to send messages quickly and privately, making it easier to cyberbully someone privately.

3. Online forums, chat rooms, and message boards-Forums, chat rooms, and message boards are places where people can talk to each other online. They can be used for positive purposes, such as discussing a topic or sharing ideas. However, they are also used for negative purposes, such as cyberbullying.  

4. Email-Email is another way that people can cyberbully each other. This can be because people hide behind their screens and cannot communicate in person or they send hateful messages to that specific teenager through email which then leads to mental health issues, wanting to commit suicide, and just wanting to be alone.

5. Protect your accounts -  in this teens need to have some type of protection already on their computers. This is to keep cyber bullying under control as much as possible but this wouldn’t just be for basic means of cyber protection but also advanced computer protection.

6. Keep everything – meaning limiting gaming access and phone and mobile service access so this will also mitigate the cyber bullying so it won’t go haywire and really do damage to the teenager , parent , family, community .

7. Online gaming spaces- Many teenagers play online games to get away from their troubles. However, these games can lead to cyberbullying in the sense of the parents do not check on the kids or not setting up parental controls that can block them from cyberbullying attacks So, we must be empathetic to those who have experienced these situations and help them however we can. According to the cyberbullying research center they believe that we can stop or prevent cyberbullying in teenagers in these 2 ways.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first way to prevent cyberbullying in teens is to block the person doing the bullying. Nearly one-third of those who had been cyberbullied told us this had worked for them (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying). For example, a 16-year-old girl from Ohio said: “I was able to stop it by blocking the person (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying). They then opened another account and left mean comments. I threatened to report them to Twitter, and they stopped (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying). They were worried about getting banned from Twitter, so they stopped (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying).” 2. Ignore- Another frequently reported solution was to just ignore the cyberbullying (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying). Many students told us that when they ignored it, eventually the mistreatment stopped (Patchin, Teens talk: What works to stop cyberbullying). A 16-year-old girl from Texas responded: “Let time pass and they finally left me alone. They got bored when no one responded the way they wanted them to. In conclusion what we really need to do is allow students who are using a variety of strategies to stop cyberbullying.

In the end, we decided to include as many potentially viable options as possible that we could think of and let the reader decide what would be best in their unique situation. Adults: We encourage you to discuss these responses with the young people in your lives. Make sure they are fully equipped to handle a cyberbullying situation should it arise. Also convey to them that you are there to help should things escalate beyond their abilities.
