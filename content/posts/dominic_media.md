# Ted Talk by Tom Osborn

Tom Osborn is from Kenya and in his TED talk he talks about the mental health crisis, specifically in Kenya. Some statistics Tom mentioned that stuck out to me were that half of those 19 or younger in Kenya experience some symptoms of mental health issues, and that half of Kenya is 19 or younger. That means that about 25% of Kenya’s population suffers some kind of mental health issues. The thing Tom really does not like about this is the current approach towards mental health.   

Furthermore, Tom believes that we should work from the bottom-up. Meaning, we should aim to help younger people with mental health issues. Once this is done, when they are older, they will no longer have those issues, or will at least know how to combat them. Then the cycle can continue, and we would keep helping the younger generation with their mental health issues. This is an interesting idea and one that I think could very well be applicable to the mental health crisis caused by TikTok. If we can start by helping the younger generation, the one that uses TikTok the most, we can have a system where mental health may be on the decline, and those with more urgent mental health issues can be helped sooner.  

When looking at the three Cs of credibility, Tom does a fantastic job with all of them. To show that he cares, right from the start he begins to get on a personal level with the audience by talking about his childhood and the moment he realized he might have some mental health issues. To show his competence, he talks in a slow, but confident voice to show he knows what he is talking about. He mentions times when he noticed himself and others not in a great place mentally. He also listed statistics that were relevant to the points he was trying to make. To show his character, Tom talks about the approach that is working with the youth in Kenya. He is seeing improvement in the mental health of those in Kenya and wants to share his results with the world in order to try and help the crisis. He may not solve it, but having the courage to talk about what he has endured and what he has done since shows how great of a person he is.  

Ultimately, Tom was a wonder speaker and got his point across to just shy of 2 million people. He utilizes the three Cs of credibility to win over anyone watching the video and makes them believe every word he says.  If the video becomes more widespread, maybe more people will take Tom’s findings and do more with them. I certainly see a world in which taking a bottom-up approach could at least help the mental health crisis across the world, especially in a world where TikTok’s algorithm digs those with mental health issues into a deeper hole. If we can help those who are young and in the hole, we can set up our future generations for success, and in the end, create a world that is better to live in
