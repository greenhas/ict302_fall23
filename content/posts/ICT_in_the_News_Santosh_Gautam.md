# ICT in the News


# Introduction

In this digital era of science and technology, there has been an increasing number of social media and platforms where people share and communicate information. This increasing number has made it harder to trace the right information. The article that I found on the internet relates to the topic of online misinformation. The title of the article is, “How Social Media Amplifies Misinformation More Than Information.” The article was published in the New York Times on Oct 13, 2022, by Steven Lee Myers (Myers, 2022). In this blog post, I am going to evaluate the above article thoroughly and critically.


# Article Analysis

In the above news article, Myers talks about how networking sites circulate misinformation to a greater extent. The article presents the results of the Integrity Institute, which provides reports on online misinformation analysis (Allen, 2023). The intended audience of this article can be anyone who uses social media and shares the information. The goal of this article is to inform the audiences about how the social media platform uses the algorithm and propagates false information to the users. The article references the research and findings that come from the Integrity Institute to analyze the topic. The article also focuses on the negative sides that can result from misinformation when social media platforms spread inaccurate information. In the article, Myers focuses on informing the readers about the increasing misinformation issues. The author presented the article by connecting it to social platforms so that the readers could easily relate to the topic. The article references the Integrity Institute, which monitors and evaluates the spread of misinformation on social platforms. 

One of the essential materials that I utilize while evaluating and analyzing the article is the “CRAAP” test which is available from the University of Kentucky libraries website (Research Guides: Undergraduate Library Research: Evaluating Information, 2023). Firstly, the article that I chose was published in The New York Times which is a reputable and trustworthy source for readers and audiences. Secondly, the article was written by Steven Lee Myers, who writes articles encompassing misinformation topics. According to The New York Times, Steven Lee Myers was awarded the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for public service (Steven Lee Myers - the New York Times, n.d.). This provides the author's credibility on the subject matter. Thirdly, the article focused on providing information and evaluating the spread of misinformation on social platforms for the readers. Fourthly, the article was published one year ago, which still makes it relevant to the current scenario. Finally, the article is supported by evidence from sources such as the Integrity Institute and the International Fact-checking Network. Overall, the topic was well supported by the research data from external sources, making it more reliable and credible. 

Myers presents the article to the reader by using simple language and referencing the evidence from the data that comes from the Integrity Institute. The article focuses on providing reliable information on how misinformation can spread on social media platforms, and this helps the reader evaluate any information that is being shared or found on these platforms. The article focuses on providing qualitative information rather than quantitative information by referencing reliable external sources. The reports that come from the Integrity Institute provide enough evidence to support the main point by providing the amplification factors about the different social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. The amplification factor that is referenced by the Integrity Institute provides evidence of how false information spreads more quickly on the platforms than accurate information (Myers, 2022). I believe Myers presents the information consistently and logically throughout the article by referencing the data that comes from the Integrity Institute to address how the false information intensifies on the networking sites rather than the accurate information. Throughout the article, Myers references the evidence to support the main point of the article. Myers also provides references to the International Fact-Checking Network which can be used by the readers to check the authenticity of the information found on the networking sites (The Poynter Institute, 2023).

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I believe Myers presents information throughout the article that is well supported by the facts and data that come from external resources such as the Integrity Institute. The simple and precise language format helps the readers understand the topic easily. Throughout the article, we can find information that is relevant and references the data from the sources by using factual data rather than focusing on the reader's sentiments. Overall, the article raises key questions about misinformation in this digital age. Every one of us, including social media platforms, individuals, and the government should be responsible and work together to share reliable information on networking sites. As mentioned in the article, there are fact-checking sites that can be utilized to analyze the information. In this 21st-century digital world, it is crucial to seek information that is both reliable and comes from trustworthy sources. By doing so, we can efficiently save our valuable time and readily identify the spread of false information in our surroundings.
