Bailey Parnell is a CEO and affluent speaker regarding mental health and digital wellbeing. In this TEDx talk, she highlighted key aspects regarding social media and how it can be detrimental to the mental health of individuals.

# About the TEDx Talk
Parnell begins the talk by acting out the self-talk the average social media user will speak when they are scrolling through the posts of others. She gives an example of saying, "Wow I am fat, do I have enough likes, and what am I doing with my life", etc. These are classic examples of how the hyperconnectivity and comparison culture of social media such as Instagram and others can lead to stress and impact a user's mental health. Parnell's foundation for this talk is based on the 4 key stressors of social media use: the highlight reel– as explained previously–, social currency, fear of missing out or FOMO, and online harassment.

# Main Points Discussed
Parnell compares social media to a currency more specifically "something we use to attribute value to a good or service." This is quite a stark idea, but she goes on to give examples of how likes, comments, and shares have become a social currency that we use to attribute value to something. She explains that it is similar to the economy of attention in marketing and how every like, share, or comment is recorded and attribute value to a product, but the problem is that the user is the product in this case. This is a great example of a stressor when one is attributing value to their person based on how many likes or comments they received.

Parnell cites a credible study from the University of Ottawa and Carleton University regarding FOMO, saying "7/10 students would get rid of their social media networking accounts were it not for fear of being left out of the loop." This is a legitimate concept that has been studied regarding the fear of missing out on a potential connection, event, or opportunity. The use of this source and relating it to the audience is another aspect that presents Parnell as being a credible speaker.

# Last Points and Conclusion
The final stressor presented by Parnell, and a great example of what I perceive as her caring about her audience, is the aspect of online harassment. She cites PEW research data regarding the prevalence of online harassment and says that 40 percent of online adults have experienced the phenomenon. She goes on to give specific examples of individuals who were harassed online, some quite extremely, and then gives examples of what a user could do to better preserve their mental health online and have a better online experience. In this portion of the talk, Parnell lists examples of what one could do such as: recognizing the problem, auditing your social media following to see what stressors you have such as asking questions like, "Do I feel better after scrolling on Facebook, and how many times did I check likes, and why a I responding this way to this photo." Throughout this talk, Parnell has done a great job of presenting herself as a credible speaker and offering a relatable user experience for how detrimental to one's mental health social media can be.
