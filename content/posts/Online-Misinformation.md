# Online Misinformation 

With the growing use of technology, humans have shifted to using online platforms to communicate information and share their ideas. In this 21st-century digital world, there has been an increasing use of social media platforms by people all around the world. Information can be easily shared and communicated in a second all around the world with the use of the internet. The American Psychological Association defines misinformation as any information that is incorrect or faulty (“Misinformation and Disinformation,” 2023). Online misinformation has a direct effect on the public seeking authentic evidence. It has a wide range of impacts, from the public to organizations to almost every human being from around the world. In this blog post, I am going to explore the issues, background, causing factors, and impacts of online misinformation on the public. 

Misinformation can be commonly prevalent while communicating with people, and online misinformation is another form of it that takes place through the use of the internet, such as social media, e-newspapers, and other online platforms. The various categories of misinformation are misleading news, rumors, propaganda, etc. It can be challenging to identify whether the information is accurate or not, but it is very important to critically evaluate the information before sharing it on online platforms. Misleading information can be complex to identify since it can be used to influence the viewpoint of the public. Misinformation can create a sense of insecurity and pose other negative consequences. This can also lead to making false judgments and decisions based on inaccurate information. Pew Research Center data says that 50% of American adults get news via social platforms on a frequent basis (Social Media and News Fact Sheet, Pew Research Center, 2022). Thus, misinformation has been a challenging task in this age of digitalization, where there has been maximum use of online platforms. It has further complicated recognizing reality from fantasy. Due to the variance in education regarding the use of digital media, there has been a gap in knowledge about the use of online content and its relevancy. Thus, people share information without any relevant source on online platforms, which makes it difficult for the public to distinguish whether the information is true or not. 

Misinformation can also happen when people share information without checking its validity and authenticity. People often share information on social media, and it can spread all around the world. This is a common factor where information is shared on applications and internet sites. On the other side, malicious actors can use online platforms to communicate information and gain access to sensitive information from the public, which often circulates rapidly among people. Similarly, bias can also create a replication of false information over the internet, as people tend to focus on the information based on their values and might be different from other people’s viewpoints from around the world. Furthermore, the publisher who produces the content may provide information in a specific and targeted manner. 

Another situation that plays a role in spreading misinformation is during times of emergencies and natural calamities where people actively seek information and might get trapped in false information. This further creates insecurity among the people, and people tend to follow and share the information without any fact-checking or authentication. This can be the time when hackers can actively engage to share and get access to the information of the general public and organizations, which can lead to misleading activities such as deep fakes. On the website Nevada Today, Britt talks about how deepfakes may generate deceptive information and cause ambiguity over significant matters (Britt, 2023). Britt further shares Dr. Pain's thoughts on addressing the process of detecting deep fakes in the article (Britt, 2023). 

There are also positive aspects linked to online information, such as the fact that people from all around the world can get access to the information in a second using the internet. For example, during times of natural calamities, people can actively gain information and help during the crisis. Thus, the fundamental part is to check the authenticity of the information and critically evaluate it. The intake of information is entirely based on the individual's tactics. But, with the increasing use of the internet, there have been negative impacts linked to how information is circulating on online platforms. With the growing use of technology, humans have shifted to using social media to communicate and share their ideas. Thus, when misleading information is shared online, it harms individuals, communities, organizations, and the virtual world as a whole. This will directly hamper decision-making activities, as the false information might lead to bad decisions and affect the individual directly in personal as well as professional settings. Also, it creates confusion among the public about which information to follow since exposure to multiple false information might create frustration among the people and directly affect proficiency and capabilities. Thus, false information can create a negative mindset and directly affect mental wellness. Since the individuals represent the community, organization, and country, the risks linked to false information are also associated with all the aspects represented by the person. Moreover, misinformation can also hinder the economic sector, such as the stock market and financial decisions. On the Investopedia website, Kenton talks about the effect on the economy when misinformation circulates and the prices have been influenced (Kenton, 2021). Kenton further talks about the factors that drive the misleading economy by explaining the false information that is broadcasted through the mass media, fraudulent activities in monetary activities, and contents that spread through various online mediums (Kenton, 2021). 

Hence, the circulation of false information on the internet has a direct influence on the individual, the community, and the associated organization. Thus, the individual should take action on their own to actively identify the risks associated with false information before sharing it online and should actively utilize the resources and knowledge to seek and share authentic information. 

The “CRAAP” test material provided on the University of Kentucky libraries websites can be utilized to analyze the information more reliably and credibly (Research Guides: Undergraduate Library Research: Evaluating Information, 2023). Thus, it is very important to consider ethical accountability while delivering the information. This will help the people around us get access to reliable information. The collective effort from every individual, organization, online channel, media, and government is essential to tackle the online misinformation issues and safeguard our society and world from the adverse impacts created by misinformation in this digital world.
