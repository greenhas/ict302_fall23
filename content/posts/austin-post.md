For my blog, I wanted to discuss an ICT topic that impacts everyone but isn’t thought about a lot. There are a lot of interesting issues being given attention right now, like AI, social media, and cybersecurity. But one that I think is far more applicable to many people’s everyday life and should be given as much attention as the ones I listed previously, is consumer data privacy. We provide our data to businesses every day through a variety of different transactions, including using credit or debit cards, reserving hotels, or paying interest. People are making these kinds of transactions every day, and without the proper protection, this data could be at risk of falling into the wrong hands. In this blog, I’ll discuss consumer data privacy, who is affected and how they are affected by it, and some examples of the laws and policies that have been passed to address the issue.  

#### Defining the Issue
First, let’s define the issue. Consumer data is the trail of information customers can leave behind. This information can come from social media networks, mobile apps, call center communications, and purchases. Unfortunately for these consumers, this trail can be left behind and compromise some personal information. Companies can collect this data to analyze and better attract and retain customers. These companies must be careful not to mishandle this information while trying to use the data to improve the customer experience.  

#### Effects on People
Because the actions that leave data are so common and are done every day by millions of people, almost everyone is affected by the privacy of their data. Unfortunately, this leaves all those consumers at risk. Sensitive information can be accidentally leaked, or hackers can breach companies’ security. They can sell this data to scammers, or possibly even use it for identity theft. According to the 2022 Thales Customer Digital Trust Index, 33% of consumers globally have been victims of a data breach. When we look at US consumers the number rises even higher to 48%. 

#### Positives
On the bright side, the US government has acted on this issue recently. For example, back in 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act was passed. This law gives the consumer many more rights, including the right to know what personal information a business collects about them and how it is used and shared, the right to delete personal information collected from them and the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of their personal information. Other states have passed similar laws recently as well. In 2021, Colorado passed a comprehensive data privacy law, and this year Delaware passed a similar law, and Hawaii currently has a personal consumer data bill pending.  

#### Closing Thoughts
For future blog posts, I want to talk more in-depth about some of the potential harms for those affected, including possibly discussing some personal accounts of issues like identity theft and financial fraud. I also want to explore some modern and effective ways that an individual can protect themselves from these issues, including encrypting your data and having your data backed up so it can be recovered in case of a disaster. Lastly, I want to highlight some laws that have been passed regarding data privacy, to show how the government is aiding in fighting this problem, as well as some bills that have been struck down, to investigate some reasons behind not passing these laws.
