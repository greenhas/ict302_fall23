Hey guys, I hope you are all doing well! Welcome to my tech blog, where I will specifically be focusing on facial recognition technology and the nuances associated with it. I will write four types of blogs, including an Issue Introduction, ICT in the News, an Infographic, and a Media-related post. For this piece, I will be introducing the issue of facial recognition technology and will talk about its different positive and negative impacts on society. Yes, I know that sounds boring, but you all will be all right (hopefully). Also, bear with me as I tend to write in a more formal tone (though some jokes will be thrown in there lol). I hope you guys my work!

## FRTs Impacts on People, Law Enforcement, and Businesses 
Facial recognition technology is a new and emergent technology that presents many benefits to society. These range from making life more convenient, helping law enforcement solve crimes, and holding lazy employees accountable. However, with those benefits come several challenges like privacy/safety breaches, false arrests via racial bias, and the potential to shut down a business. What follows is an analysis of how facial recognition technology impacts three separate groups of society: the public, the police, and businesses. Buckle up because this will be good!

## People 
Bear with me guys, I am going to get a little “personal” with this section (he he). Thankfully, facial recognition technology has helped me out since high school. While unlocking a phone seems like a trivial matter, it can be a hassle typing in a password if it locks or utilizing the buggy fingerprint system. Beyond just unlocking my cellular device, FRT has made my life more convenient in many areas. For example, I utilize the feature whenever I am trying to pay for something via Apple Pay. Not only does that prevent me from having to type in my passcode when trying to purchase something using that digital feature, but I also do not have to go digging for my physical wallet just to pull out a debit card. This seems like laziness personified but trust me when I say transactions are much more seamless using Apple Pay (and having Face ID to load up your card takes literal milliseconds).

Staying on the topic of transactions, facial recognition technology makes those that occur on my phone seamless as well. Whenever I want to get an app or buy something on one, I can just use Face ID to verify a purchase instead of typing in my Apple ID passcode like I had to in middle school. Again, laziness is illustrated here, but who can deny luxury when it is available to them? Certainly not me. 

Looking from a macro perspective, facial recognition technology can cause serious issues for society. As Taylor Kay Lively stated in her article “Facial Recognition in the United States: Privacy Concerns and Legal Developments” faces are not something that can be easily encrypted or changed, making it easier for bad actors to reveal different facts about your life based on face-associated data. She followed that up by listing several different risks that could play out if FRT data is stolen, such as harassment, identity theft, and stalking (Lively, 2021, para. 6). That is a scary scenario for anyone to consider, much less a college student trying to get by. Maybe I should wear masks more often (absolutely not). 

That also plays perfectly into the point that people may feel like they have no privacy because of facial recognition technology. Being recorded and scanned can make the public feel like they are being judged for anything they do (Gargaro, 2023, para. 2023). Much like employees in the business sector, most people do not want to be watched for no reason. That brings discomfort and worry among civilians just trying to vibe out to some Travis Scott.  

## Law Enforcement 
For obvious reasons, FRTs can provide great assistance to the police when trying to search for a wanted criminal. According to Eira et al. (2021), they can expedite the investigation process, which could lead to faster arrests and the prevention of future crimes. Think about it, if the police were not able to match and recognize a criminal’s face based on camera footage, the process of bringing them in and punishing them would take much longer. They would only be able to go off anonymous tips and hearsay (I can’t even imagine what they went through in the early 1900’s lmao). However, the advent of FRTs changed the way police operate now, eliminating any excuse for them to complain about a lack of information on a suspect. The hundreds of thousands of faces in digital databases around the world make policing that much easier (at least I hope it does). For context, a study of 99 countries done by a team at CompariTech (you guessed it, a tech company) showed that 70 percent of those countries’ police forces used facial recognition technology (Bischoff, 2022, para. 9). 

While this is indirectly tied to law enforcement, airports use facial recognition technology to verify that people’s faces match the ones on their IDs. This is done via a quick picture officials use to match with something like a driver’s license or passport. According to Oosto, an information technology group, this process is called one-to-one verification (Oosto, 2022, para. 6). This is an important system because airport security can quickly catch a criminal trying to commit identity theft/fraud. It also speeds up the verification process because the workers do not have to look up a picture from a book or some other “ancient” artifact.   

While FRTs can help law enforcement identify convicts, there is also the risk of false recognition resulting in an innocent minority being wrongfully arrested and sent to jail because of the lack of facial diversity in these databases. For instance, Nijeer Parks, a 31-year-old black man who lives in Paterson, New Jersey, received a call one day from his grandmother that the police in a town 30 miles away from his home (Woodbridge) had been looking for him. Knowing he had not committed a crime, Parks walked into their city PD ready to clear his name of any abrasions of the law. Things were not that simple, however, as they arrested him on the spot and sent him to jail for eleven days. After everything was cleared up, Parks learned the main reason for the arrest was the fact that the FRT the department used was not able to distinguish his face from the real culprit (who was also a darker-skinned fellow) (General & Sarlin, 2021, para. 1-4, 5 and 6). This story further proves that racial bias is still present today, even speaking from an FRT standpoint. Sarlin even points out in his article that while the new technology has become more accurate, it is more prone to errors when comparing/contrasting the faces of darker-skinned people (General & Sarlin, 2021, para. 7).  

Unfortunately, this same scenario could play out for Asian people as well. According to a study done by the U.S. government, facial recognition algorithms are far less accurate when identifying Asian faces (and African Americans as just mentioned) compared to Caucasian faces. Moreover, research done by the University of Essex in the United Kingdom showed that facial recognition tests were accurate only 19 percent of the time regarding black and Asian faces (Ahmad, 2023, para. 8). This could prove especially troublesome because of their similar eye structure (no racial, obviously). You know there’s a problem when other countries are coming up with the same findings as the U.S. These tech workers need to (globally) get it together! 

## Businesses 
From small local businesses here in Lexington to big corporations like Microsoft, facial recognition technologies can have a positive impact. For example, companies can use them to track employee attendance and see if everyone is where they’re supposed to be (Abbas, 2022, para. 5). This is huge for bosses who want to hold people in the office accountable. You wouldn’t want Bob from accounting roaming around on the IT floor without a good reason. Also, any executive would demand their employees to show up to work every day (on time, mind you) to help put their shift in for the company. 

Another positive impact FRTs have on businesses is how they help with security. If the CTO wants to implement some form of two-factor authentication for when employees check in, they could utilize a facial recognition system that verifies each person’s identity (Johnson, 2023, para. 9-10). Recently, I wrote a paper talking about how drones can pose a massive security threat to companies because of their inconspicuous presence and hacking capabilities. In that piece, however, I did not address how humans can threaten the integrity of a business as well. That is why facial recognition technology is so helpful in that instance because of how advanced it is, and how much it will continue to evolve. Verifying your personnel is much more important than making a profit, you know (just kidding, no one can afford to go bankrupt).

While facial recognition technology can have a positive impact on businesses, there are also some drawbacks. For starters, there are some major privacy concerns that FRTs bring up. Yes, making sure everyone is who they say they are, is important, but most employees do not want to work somewhere where they feel like they are being watched. That could lead to higher turnover rates, which could affect the entire company’s morale (Industry Today, 2023, para. 16). 

In a broader sense, facial recognition technology could more or less spell doom for a company. Like any database, those holding face-related data are vulnerable to being breached (Read, 2022, para. 10). If people found out a trusted tech company (like Cognitec, a surveillance/video corporation) was breached and hackers were able to harass them based on their faces, that would mean big trouble for the people holding that data (Steines, 2023). No one wants a random stranger peeking in on their daily lives without their consent (unless you are a weird person). Therefore, customer fallout would be inevitable, leading to the eventual destruction of the business.

## How to Make FRTs Less of a Headache 
Looking at facial recognition technology, there appear to be many positives and negatives associated with it. However, that statement right there basically tells us it is not perfect, and with every imperfection comes headaches. Thankfully for us, there are several ways to mitigate those (insert the Tylenol reference here). For starters, the government can implement policies that limit the amount of time companies can store facial data. Even though facial recognition technology can be helpful when solving crimes, the faces of the victims do not need to be kept in storage (West et al., 2019, para. 7). No victim wants to be harassed after a case has already been solved, especially if any physical damage they suffered is caught on camera. Shoot, I know I wouldn’t want to be exposed in front of my friends. Not only is that embarrassing, but it could lead to further harassment down the line (though jokes would eventually come up in conversation).

Now let me put in my two cents on how facial recognition technologies could become less of a headache. Forbid everyone but cell phone companies and law enforcement from having access to facial recognition technologies. Now I know this sounds extreme, but it is the best way to keep a leash on it. At least with a company like Apple, more people would be made aware if there was a data breach. That goes for law enforcement as well. However, for a corporation like Cognitec (referenced earlier in the blog), most people would not even know if their facial data was breached unless they utilized their services, especially because they are a lesser-known company (Steines, 2023). While the risk of a data breach is plausible for any tech giant or police department, limiting access would lessen that chance. It is easier to put out a smaller fire than a huge one that is still spreading.
