Communication, entertainment, and health—what do these aspects of humanity have in common? They are all connected through technology. Everything today uses some sort of device and an Internet connection. With the growing amount, it is important for you to know what cybersecurity is, how it affects online interactions, and how to protect yourself. Cybersecurity involves protecting businesses and individuals from people unauthorized access, digital attacks, and other threats (“What is Cybersecurity,” 2021).

Think about what you type regularly on your phone or computer: your bank information, passwords for personal and work accounts, and other personal information. This is perfect to have for convenience and ease of access, but it increases the likelihood of future security concerns, like getting information stolen. This blog will focus on cybersecurity knowledge and tips to protect your data from cyber-attacks. By breaking down cybersecurity language, businesses and individuals can be informed about what measures to take to protect themselves online.

**Cybersecurity**

The overall purpose of enforcing cybersecurity within organizations follows the CIA triad, which stands for the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data. 

- *Confidentiality* ensures that private and sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals. For example, regular company employees should not be able to see any confidential information stored by the company, such as customer’s personal and/or banking information. Standards and controls are put in place to track the authorized access of the data and systems. 
- *Integrity* ensures that the protected data is authentic, accurate, and reliable (“What is the CIA Triad,” n.d.). The data held by a company or organization should be correct and not be tampered with. If a user visits a website, all the information should be accurate and trustworthy. If it is not, it can damage the reputation of employees and the company. 
- *Availability* simply means that the data should be available for the company and customers. Data is needed to ensure the company and customers can get what they are looking for. This component includes backups of data in case an incident occurs, or networks are down (“What is the CIA Triad,” n.d.). Organizations have documents in place for when these incidents occur, like disaster recovery plans or incident response plans. These plans describe the steps taken if there is an active threat or other negative event that affects the ability to use and access the organization’s stored data. 

Overall, the CIA triad is a baseline for protecting the data and information systems maintained by an organization. It helps evaluate access privileges, identify vulnerabilities, and implement policies to maintain the system. 

**Types of Data and Information**

There are different types of data that companies have access to that are important to protect. Depending on if a user is a customer, vendor, or employee, they will have different data that needs storing, encrypting, and maintaining. The University of Illinois describes these different types in good detail. They split the data up by High Risk, Sensitive, Internal, and Public (“Data Classification Overview,” n.d.). 

- *High Risk data* includes Personal Health Information (HIPAA), Credit Card Information (PCI-DSS), Personal Identifiable Information (PII), banking information, passwords, and more. Any threat to this data can involve activity like identity theft, financial loss, invasion of privacy, and many more. Because this data is so important to individuals, companies who have access to this data have to ensure access privileges and protection against breaches and threats. This is one of the main reasons companies are required to disclose security policies to customers and users. Doing so establishes a sense of trust between users and the organizations. 

- *Sensitive data* is a special type of information that should not be accessed by people without special clearance or access. This includes student records (FERPA), NDAs, personal employee information, etc. These should also be kept to only those who have authorized access and should not be easily accessible for the public. Not keeping this information classified is a major cybersecurity threat. 

- *Internal data* is information used internally and created by the organization. Examples would include intellectual property, unpublished work, and other classified information. In the case of data from a university, this could damage the reputation or even result in fines with any data leaks. 

- Lastly, *public data* is information that can be viewed and shared with others. This data is easily accessed by all users and poses no cybersecurity threat when compromised. Examples of this would be information shown explicitly on an organization’s website. Understanding the categories of data can make users aware of who they give their data to and help understand which data is most important to keep safe. Businesses, employees, and customers should be educated on these precautions for cyber-attacks.

**Cyber Attacks**
The biggest threat to an organization’s stored data and information is called a cyber-attack. There are many threats faced for both companies and individuals to steal data or disrupt online information systems. The most common methods of attack include malware/ransomware, phishing, spoofing, and identity-based attacks. 

- *Malware*, or malicious software, is used to infiltrate a computer, network or system and cause harm. Some types of malwares include ransomware, viruses, and worms, which all steal information or data using a variety of methods. Once inside the system, the malware can block access to important parts of the system, download harmful software, and modify files. 

- *Ransomware* includes blocking access to the system. For example, they could hold and encrypt a company’s data and refuse to release it until they receive a certain amount of money from the company.

- *Phishing* has become a popular method of obtaining personal information. This involves people using emails, messages, phone calls, and social media with misleading messages to steal credit card information and passwords, or trick users into installing malware. Some involve attackers pretending to be your bank or credit card company and tricking you into giving them your bank details and passwords.  

- Similar to phishing is *spoofing*. Spoofing more specifically impersonates a business or person. For example, an attacker could create an email address that looks identical to your peers or coworkers at first glance. They might have disguised their real email address or recreated your colleagues email address by using letters in the email address that look similar. At first glance, you might not notice and either click a link they sent or send sensitive information directly to them. They can spoof individuals or companies, which can lead to information being stolen from both the company and customers or users.

Lastly, there are a variety of identify-based attacks, but the most common is called *Man-in-the-Middle* attack (MitM). This is also known as an eavesdropping attack because the attacker sits in the middle of a transaction and “eavesdrops” to steal data. This occurs if someone uses an unprotected public Wi-Fi network or if using a breached device (“What is a Cyber Attack,” n.d.). 
 
**Protecting Yourself**
The goal of the blog is not to scare people about these cybersecurity threats, but to make everyone aware and inform them on what to do (or what not to do). Understanding the tactics that attackers use can help understand ways to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. Here are some ways you can easily protect yourself from being a victim of one of these attacks. Learning these tips can help prevent attacks from happening to you as an individual or to employees at companies. 

- *Use Strong Passwords:*
The most obvious prevention method is to have strong, secure passwords. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) suggests tips for a strong password (“Secure Our World,” n.d.). They recommend 16 characters that are randomized and unrelated. They should contain no personal information and have a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords should also not be repeated for multiple accounts. 
Another suggested method is using multi-factor authentication (MFA) when possible. This ensures two verification methods when logging in, which will prevent unauthorized access to accounts. 

- *Be Cautious:*
Because of the increasing amounts of spoofing and phishing, be cautious of links and suspicious emails. Think before you click any unknown link. If it is sent in an email, you can hover over the link to determine where the link leads you. Most larger companies, like federal banks and government organizations, will not email or call you asking for account information. You can always double check, so it is better to be safe. 
It is also suggested to make sure you have your online privacy settings on. While you should always think about what you are posting on social media, the privacy settings will further prevent attackers from learning any personal information about you. 

- *Software:*
It is important to stay up to date on software updates. Some updates include patches for vulnerabilities. If there were any security issues, the software manufacturer can fix the software or operating system by creating free updates. Some updates can be installed automatically, so you might have to check the vendor’s website. There is also anti-malware software available if you think there is malware in your device. This scans, removes, and prevents malware. Another option is installing a firewall. A firewall monitors network traffic and can allow or block based on set rules (“What is a Firewall,” n.d.). This can help block threats if they try to enter your system. 

The world of cybersecurity can seem overwhelming when you are new to it. Simplifying these cybersecurity concepts and issues will provide you with the information needed to prevent and deal with cyber-attacks. With the large volume of personal data that we rely on our devices and networks for, the importance of cybersecurity increases to protect our data and preserve our privacy.
