# The Cheating Usage of Technology 

Technology is both good and bad, serving several purposes for all its users. It can help us to connect with others faster, complete tasks faster, and find information faster. However, it can also be used in malicious ways, such as cyberbullying, hacking, and cheating. I will be discussing cheating on this blog and the topics surrounding it. Firstly, according to the Cambridge Dictionary (n.d.), a trusted dictionary source, cheating means “to behave in a dishonest way in order to get what you want,” and additionally in the process lying about everything you did that was unethical. The specific definition that I am talking about here is in the academic sense, not in a romantic or otherwise non-academic sense. Cheating is a huge part of academic dishonesty, which is the academic fraud students perform that goes against the goals of education in schools. Oftentimes, students who cheat do not even admit to having done it. This is often due to the way of human nature. Humans, no matter how young or old they are (however it is mostly younger and/or unwise), tend to not admit to having done a malicious act simply because of human nature, but we do tend to boast about ourselves to paint a positive image of ourselves, once again because of human nature. This can backfire and cause more harm than good; cheating is exactly this plus an evolving issue that will continue to get worse if nothing is done to curb the issue. 

 

# Going Deeper into the Topic of Technology and Cheating 

Now more than ever, technology has made it easier to cheat on assignments and tests. While the issue of cheating has always existed, with the recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence (AI) (e.g., ChatGPT having come out in November 2022), cheating has become more common among students, even though according to multiple sources, such as the online college resource BestColleges (2023), most students say that using AI is cheating or plagiarism. Cheating has many negative effects, such as the teacher’s decreased trust in the student, the parent’s or parents’ decreased trust in their child, the student’s self-esteem being lowered because of the failed attempt to increase their self-esteem (i.e., getting a higher grade to make it appear as if they “studied” for the test or completed their assignment “fairly”), and possible detention, or worse: school suspension of the student. 

Punishment, in my opinion, seems to be worse in college than in K-12 schools because of the expected professionalism students are supposed to have or at least start to have once they enter college, and this may very well be because of the more enforced student of conduct. K-12 is typically the time for students to make and learn from their mistakes so they will not slip up once they are legal adults and in college or the workforce. Parents are also only involved with being let know of cheating in K-12 because the students are still minors (until they reach 18 years old). The parents of college students would only know of the incidence of cheating if they were directly told by the student because FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) grants parents access to their child’s education records until the child turns 18, but most students would just keep it to themselves because that would taint their reputation if they did tell. 

 

# Statistics of Cheating  

Let us look at some of the statistics that revolve around cheating and the ways students tend to go about it. According to Zhao et al. (2023), researchers from the Society for Research in Child Development, 25.74% of Chinese second to sixth graders admitted to having cheated on exams in school. This group of students sees cheating as a negative thing (mean score of 1.64 out of 5, with 1 meaning cheating is ‘bad’ and 5 meaning it is ‘good’). “Copying answers from a neighbor during an exam” was the most common way to cheat at a mean score of 1.96 with “secretly changing a test score” being the least common way at a mean score of 1.09; interestingly, “using tools (e.g., dictionaries, cellphones, smart watches) to search for answers during an exam” was second to last with a mean score of 1.13; this is important to note for the topic of ICTs (information communication technologies) and cheating. Most of these elementary school students also said that “working harder” is the best way to avoid cheating at a mean score of 3.57, while “having a teacher who is greatly liked by their students teach the class” had the lowest score at 2.07. Also, “being punished by one's teachers” was rated the most severe consequence (3.65) with “being criticized by one's teachers” being considered the least severe (3.05). 

While not a research study, AI and data science expert Nav (2023) has some good numbers about students using AI for various purposes (but still specifically for cheating). 43% of college students surveyed have used ChatGPT or similar AI tools. 89% of the students surveyed said they use ChatGPT (or similar) for homework, 53% for essay purposes, and 48% for at-home tests. As of October 14, 2023 – the last time this article by Nav was updated – only one university has banned ChatGPT completely, which is Sciences Polytechnic in Paris and RV University in Bengaluru. In K-12 schools, 26% of teachers surveyed in a Daily Mail survey have caught a student cheating with ChatGPT, and 50% of teachers surveyed in a GovTech survey “knew at least one student who was punished or faced negative consequences for using ChatGPT to do their assignments,” (Nav, 2023). Additionally, students surveyed said that their main purpose of using ChatGPT is “to deal with anxiety or mental health issues, issues with friends, or family conflict,” (Nav, 2023), not to cheat. However, 66% of teachers surveyed have lost trust in students because of increased incidents of cheating. 22% use ChatGPT to cheat despite a high percentage (51%) stating that using ChatGPT is cheating. Lastly, 82% of college professors are aware of using AI to cheat and 72% are concerned about the issue, while only 55% of K-12 teachers are aware of it but 58% are concerned. All these statistics are from Nav (2023) as stated before. 

 

# Policies for Cheating at Schools 

Different schools have different policies (but all of them I would assume are, ‘surprisingly,’ anti-cheating) to deal with cheating among their students. The University of Kentucky (UK), the college I am currently going to, has a strict academic dishonesty policy in place. On the syllabus for each course, there is a section titled “Academic Offenses” that discusses these policies. For example, my ICT 320 Information Architecture online class has three subsections under this section: Senate Rules 6.3.1 ("Plagiarism"), Senate Rules 6.3.2 ("Cheating"), and Senate Rules 6.3.3 ("Misuse of Academic Records”). 

Plagiarism does fall under the umbrella of cheating; it is specifically stealing the words of someone else and claiming it as your own without including any clear attribution, such as adding quotations around the text or providing a URL as stated in the Senate Rules 6.3.1 ("Plagiarism"). Stealing information from a traditional source (e.g., an article, a book, a physical paper, etc.) or an ICT (e.g., a website article, computer code, a digital paper, etc.) are considered equally to be offenses even if traditional methods of plagiarism/cheating are becoming less common in favor of using an ICT because of its ease of usability and allowing more information to reach to the student. However, it should be noted that the policy does state that information given to the student through the Writing Center or a peer review that the student uses does NOT count as plagiarism because these are tutoring services directly offered by the university and are accepted as GOOD resources for students to take advantage of as a result; in fact, it is encouraged by UK that these resources are 100% used by students. 

Cheating, as said under Senate Rules 6.3.2 ("Cheating"), gives a similar definition to what I said earlier: giving yourself an aid that could end up giving you a failing or detrimental grade. Cheating also includes giving information to others and not just simply receiving information. The subsection also states that it is nonetheless cheating even if the benefit was not the original intent; cheating is the action no matter what the end goal is for the student and all instances of cheating are punished in some way or another. 

Senate Rules 6.3.3 ("Misuse of Academic Records”) talks more about the unacceptable act of changing, omitting, or falsifying a student’s academic record, whether it is done by the student, teacher, or anyone else. "Maintaining the integrity, accuracy, and appropriate privacy of student academic records is an essential administrative function of the University and a basic protection of all students,” (University Senate, 2023). Suspension for one semester is the minimum punishment, so this offense is taken very seriously at the University of Kentucky, just like plagiarism and cheating. 

The university requires that all students follow these policies and that all instructors both follow and enforce these policies on students and take any necessary action if cheating or plagiarism occurs. The way of enforcement can differ from instructor to instructor, but all of them should have the same end goal of punishment if necessary. The official source for these policies is stated by UK’s University Senate (2023). 

 

# Real Life Example of Someone Using Technology to Cheat 

I have witnessed myself the issue of someone cheating in school, a bit too vividly. One day back in March of 2016 during my first year of high school, there was this girl in my geometry class who cheated on a test with the aid of technology. She was quiet, like I am, but she tended to be an academic rebel a lot of the time, such as not completing her work on time, getting poor scores, and finally: cheating on a test. She used her phone to Google answers to the test, and she used a still very infamous resource that can be more harmful than good for students who misuse it: Chegg. She had a paid membership on Chegg that could help her ‘raise’ her low grades with little to no studying. The teacher caught her, and she had to be put in detention for a week. Her parents were also called by the teacher to let them know of the incident. When her detention period was over, she was told she had two options: 1) get at most partial credit on the test, or 2) take the test over again. The student chose to take the test over again, but she had to have the teacher in the same room while she was taking it. Had she studied thoroughly, she would not have gotten into trouble and would have never cheated with or without technology. 

Keep in mind that all of this happened before the explosive advancement of AI we are currently seeing in the 2020s. If this were to have happened today, AI tools such as ChatGPT would have been involved and not simply using Google Search to look up answers, with both being equally as bad as the other; however, AI is becoming yet another shameful option for shameless students to cheat. Also, if this were college, the punishment would be worse, such as automatically failing the class, being dismissed from the college, and other actions that no one (hopefully) would want to go through. 

 

# Why This Blog is Important 

This blog will help to curb cheating by offering ways in which cheating can be avoided, and the encouragement to use technological learning resources rather than abuse them will be emphasized as well. Further statistics will continue to be shared as evidence for the points that I make. I will be honest here: when I was planning this blog post, I went to ChatGPT to retrieve some text related to ICTs and cheating because I just did not know how or where to start writing. When I put the text “Explain cheating using technology/artificial intelligence” into the input box and hit ‘submit,’ ChatGPT brought up an extensive list of points and explanations about ICTs and cheating. I honestly did not use that much information from ChatGPT, but I did draw some inspiration from some of the points said by it to kickstart my blog post. Additionally, I try to avoid using ChatGPT as much as possible because: 1) I do not like currently popular things, 2) ChatGPT is infamous for being used to cheat, and 3) ChatGPT – and the service itself admits this – makes mistakes in its pulled-in information (e.g., incorrect answers, incorrect facts, incorrect computer code, copyrighted information, private information, etc.). Because of this, I only use ChatGPT for INSPIRATION and IDEAS, not as a FINAL PRODUCT. As Nav (2023) states very accurately and truthfully: “let’s teach students to use AI as a starting point, not the final product. Encourage them to create initial drafts with AI, then guide them on how to improve, add their own insights, and truly make it their work.” I agree all the way! And I think you should too. 

 

# Conclusion 

Every student should know how to use AI services like ChatGPT correctly so we can learn about the world without harming the world (or ourselves in an academic sense), and this blog will help to educate readers about that. Teachers and parents should keep themselves and their students fully educated on AI as a tool that can be used positively. Many are predicting that the future for AI is bright as improvements are made to it; we are currently only in the trial period for AI services after all! One thing left to say: according to Ariyo Okaiyeto et al. (2023), researchers from the International Journal of Agricultural & Biological Engineering, the developers of ChatGPT (OpenAI) have stated that they intended to never develop a Generative AI tool that provides a way to cheat, but simply to provide information generated from a Generative AI tool that can be used positively. AI tools are not entirely perfect, so use them cautiously and with an open mind. 

With all of that said, see you in my next blog post!
