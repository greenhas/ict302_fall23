# Overview of media recommendation  

I have decided to analyze the episode “Cheating in the classroom in the age of technology” under the podcast titled “Cheating and Technology” by Marshall Callaway, which can be found on Spotify. There is no information out there about Marshall Callaway, so it is not clear how they are involved with the issue or if they are a student who had to record a podcast for an assignment at school. However, it is safe to say that Callaway is very credible because everything he says in the podcast is true and relevant to the issue of using technology to cheat in school.

# Structure of Podcast

When the podcast starts, Callaway introduces the issue in a way that provides a teacher’s experience of students who have cheated using technology. One example that he brings up is a student who used a smartwatch to generate a paper that received an A+, when on average that student gets Cs on their assignments, resulting in damage to the student in both an academic and moral way and disheartenment to the teacher who is there to allow and provide legitimate success for the students.

Callaway defines cheating as an act of being dishonest or unfair to gain an advantage, similar to the definition that I gave in my first blog post. An interesting and true point that Callaway brings up is that cheating detection tools in college are more easily attained.

This is true because of the expected professionalism students are to have as they are paying for college. As I mentioned in my first blog post, K-12 is when students are expected to make mistakes and learn from them so that once they go off to college, they know better than to make the same mistakes again.

Callaway uses sources to prove his points and increase his credibility. For example, when he states that there are multiple ways for students to cheat now (that teachers may not even be aware of), he brings up examples from a software development company specializing in App Development, Agile, Cyber Security, Cloud, and DevSecOps named thoughtcodes.com that include pasting answers from the internet and not citing them, using sample essays, surfing the web during tests, etc.

He then uses a source to discuss 10 ways plus a brief explanation that teachers and administrators can follow to prevent cheating, with this source being educational consultant Applied Educational Systems.

The ways include talking about academic integrity, teaching digital responsibility, creating an anti-cheating pledge, making different versions of assessments, switching up seats on test day, managing access to personal devices, checking the settings on digital study tools, changing the structure of tests, creating an atmosphere of asking questions, and changing how success is defined in the classroom.

These two sources are focused on helping to prevent cheating with technology, so they were great sources for Callaway to reference and use as support.

 # How This Podcast Helps People

This podcast will help people with relation to the issue of using technology to cheat in school because of how informative and relevant it is to what is currently happening.

Teachers and administrators specifically can use this presented information to better their policies and actions on preventing cheating. The podcast is labeled as “Self-Help”, which is a bit weird because it can help multiple people simultaneously.

Regardless, it is a helpful podcast for teachers and administrators who may be struggling with the technology and cheating issue. It does not directly include information about AI’s impact, but it can easily be inserted into what is discussed in the podcast.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the podcast is relevant and helpful for teachers and students to stop cheating from occurring.

The podcast has only one episode, and I feel there should be at least one other episode that includes AI in the discussion. This podcast came out in July 2022, which was still before the release of ChatGPT.

ChatGPT is infamously notable for being used by students to cheat on their schoolwork and is often in discussions about the topic of using technology to cheat.

I recommend everyone to listen to this podcast to become more aware of the problem and solutions for cheating.
