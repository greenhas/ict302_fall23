## Introduction
Hello, have you ever experienced cyberbullying in an anyway ?  I know for me personally I am experiencing a situation. I will talk more in detail about this situation later in this essay. I will be speaking to you on the psychological perspectives of cyberbullying perpetration. 

## Topic Development
One reason to focus more on cyber bullying is because it is more toxic than traditional bullying, also although bullying involves imbalance and power it also requires the presence of an appreciated audience who will witness the torment and the distress the victims are experiencing (Thanzami, 2019). For example, as a child growing up, I had a hard time fitting in at school I was always being picked on and made fun of this is how experienced bullying in my life. But cyberbullying is way more different because it deals with bullying anonymously and over a screen so it is easier to be a victim of cyberbullying just as it is easier to be the victimizer of cyberbullying Due to the progression of technology specifically social media, we have seen a rise in cyberbullying and the effects it can have on the individual who would be considered the victim. For example, victims can commit suicide or even cyberbully someone else, not to mention have mental health issues but these factors are different for each person and each situation.  Sexual cyberbullying takes cyberbullying to a more intensive level due to the images, messages, phone calls or video chats one can have with that other person.  As, a result of this we see people lives go to pieces because of some sexually explicit images, messages and by just making the environment uncomfortable and unsafe from many different levels. In my opinion sexual cyberbullying is the extreme of cyberbullying.

## Daily Examples 
I also, learned that they are different signals to let one know they are being cyberbullied. For example, we have personality, Narcissism, Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, Social dominance, Anonymity, and strength differences, being a Victim of cyberbullying, Traditional bullying (Thanzami, 2019). My, thoughts on this particular section is that I can understand that bullies would want to have some form of dominance over their social situations because they want to be heard but even more so that want that power and control over the people involved in the situation which leads me to believe these are the victims and their families if the victims commit suicide or even has mental health issues. When it talks about strength differences it is talking about how the victimizer is typically stronger physically, emotionally, mentally over their victim that is why it is easy for the victim to be victimized because of the strength difference in these areas.
Bullies have a need for social dominance to be in control of the situation and the victim to make them do what they want them to do. 

## Conclusion 
To conclude I am going to talk about a current situation I am in. First of all, I received this email yesterday stating to me that I may have violated university rules and regulations because the person who sent me this email believes that I am a harasser or have harassed someone. Mind you I have never had this situation happen before and I am confused as to what is going to happen. They told me they were not going to investigate but I have to meet with them over zoom.  Furthermore, at the end of the email they say that they want to hear my response to the matter. In addition, a typically school day for on campus is I come to campus, I get work done early in the morning, I go to my classes if I have them in person that day if I don’t I do my online classes, I always have music on it helps me through my day. So, currently I don’t know who made the complaint I know I was raised better than this and I know I’m not a harasser but what should I do.
