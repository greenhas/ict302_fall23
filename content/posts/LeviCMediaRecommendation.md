# Intention of the Media Recommendation
The Ted Talk “Cybersecurity Every Day” presented by Jaya Baloo in November 2017 provides an overview of how cybersecurity affects people’s daily lives. The goal of this presentation is to spread awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and discuss individual responsibilities of cybersecurity and privacy. It serves as a wake-up call, showing the impacts of cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities that anyone can experience. 

# Author Background
Jaya Baloo is a cybersecurity expert with over twenty years working in cybersecurity and is therefore knowledgeable and credible enough to talk on this subject. She currently works as the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at Avast Software and was one of the top 100 CISO’s in 2017. Avast Software focuses on creating software that protects users’ personal information and online security. Examples of this software are antivirus and privacy browsers. From the knowledge she gained while working with Avast Software and cybersecurity in general, she often gives lectures and writes articles related to hacking, security, and quantum computing, which she mentions in this Ted Talk as well. This makes her a credible source for this topic.

# Credibility 
Baloo presented the information in an engaging and effective way, capturing the complex world of cybersecurity while reaching a large audience. She began the presentation by pulling up an audience member’s search history on the screen that she collected before the presentation. She then called out the audience member and showed his phone, which she “hacked” and changed the background to “You’ve Been Hacked.” She later explains that this was a member of her team (as actually hacking this member would be illegal). However, this first example shows the audience her credibility and captures their attention. It also proves to the audience how important the topic is, and how easily an “ordinary person” can be targeted. 

# Analysis 
When presenting the information, she was mostly descriptive and used language that everyone would be able to understand. However, there was one moment where she brought up the Equixfax breach and stated that she “will not even explain it because you should know that.” This emphasizes the significance of the breach, but also assumes that everyone would know, when that might not be true. It would have been helpful to include a brief description of what occurred in order to reach everyone in the audience.  She otherwise broke down the terms and explanations she used and presented the material clearly. 

# Utility for Viewers
To explain her ideas, she includes statistics and facts about how common and easy hacking it these days. This included a digital attack map, which shows the number of attacks per day and where they occur. She provided concrete examples of hacking incidents and explained how they started. This included threats to personal devices, critical infrastructures, medical systems, and military operations. 

# Summary
Overall, the Ted Talk is a call to action for every user with a device and can help people understand more about cybersecurity in their daily lives. Baloo’s credibility and knowledge on cybersecurity allows the audience to understand a complex topic and the impact it will have on their life. It helps users understand their responsibility for their privacy. Baloo describes hardware and software as “default by design,” and urges users to consider the security of their devices as an inherent aspect of them, as it should not be overlooked. By delivering compelling examples and accurate statistics, the presentation emphasizes an individual’s role of cybersecurity in their own lives. They describe how common attacks are, and how vulnerable users are. With these examples and Baloo’s knowledge, it shows that cybersecurity is important for everyone in this digital age, making this Ted Talk a valuable presentation to watch.

The media source that I have chosen for this assignment is a TED talk given by Mark Mortensen, an Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD.  INSEAD is a non-profit business school for the world. Knowing this about Mortensen and the establishment where he conducts his gives off a more credible reason to trust him. Mortensen talks about the balance of remote work and its justification within the social fabric of modern organizations. Mortensen talks about potential repercussions that remote work may have and/or any benefits that said organizations can gain. What is interesting about this TED talk is the delivery that Mortensen goes for with his setting. A strong standpoint of defending remote work is shown throughout Mortensen’s speech as he gives examples of thriving businesses implementing remote work. It also says something about his opinion on the matter by the fact that he is giving this TED talk remotely from his home office (something I haven’t seen before but is more fitting for this topic than most). Mortensen gives off a credible reputation by listing real-time perspectives from businesses encountering hybrid work for the better or for the worse. He breaks down the idea of remote work and splits it up into three real business hypothetical issues that establish a clearer derivative of the topic. 

This piece of media is extremely helpful for those encountering remote work, its infrastructure, and potential burnout. The reasoning is that Mortensen, through his talk, makes remote work a clearer phenomenon for the employee, the stakeholders, and or the executive heads at any organization. This TED talk primarily applies to the target audience of those who are experiencing remote work and recognizes that the world, since COVID and the boom of hybrid infrastructures, is indeed changing. I think that Mortensen does a good job connecting to these themes and applying what he knows about the topic to positively interact with the viewers/audience. This topic and this TED talk aren’t necessarily only going to apply to those within the phenomenon. I would say that anyone with a curious interest in the idea of working from home could gain something of value from Mortensen’s presentation. 

All in all, remote work is a topic that I think should be of the best interest to investigate. Whether you are currently working from home, considering it, or know someone who is, it's important to put the phenomenon into a more in-depth frame of perspective. Mortensen’s presentation on the topic does a great job of doing just this. Breaking down the topic of remote work not only allows you to conceptualize it in a more authentic and realistic frame but also gives a chance for more individual expression within the workplace wherever it may be. While a lot of individuals may have their own opinions on the remote workplace, this piece of content gives more real-world intuitions about the practice and how it can be determined to keep productivity constant. This justifies why Mortensen’s TED talk is a great media recommendation for my topic within ICT.
