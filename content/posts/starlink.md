Hey guys, today I want to talk about some cool recent technology that is changing the world: **Starlink Satellite Internet**.

## What is Starlink
Satellite internet has been around for a while, so what's different about Starlink? Starlink is a much larger project than any satellite constellation has ever been. As of August 2023, SpaceX has launched over 5,000 Starlink satellites into low orbit around the globe. Nearly 12,000 satellites are already planned to be a part of the initial constellation with the possibility of later expansion up to 42,000. What makes these statistics even crazier is that according to a website called “Orbiting Now” there are currently 8,877 TOTAL satellites right now in orbit. Starlink’s constellation is already more than half of the entire amount of satellites orbiting earth. Starlink provides internet service for $120 a month and the equipment costs $499 when first setting it up. The equipment package comes with a dish, cable and router that are easy to set up. All you have to do is plug it in and make sure it has a clear view of the sky and the dish will orient itself to connect to the best satellite it can.

## Advantages of Starlink
The amount of satellites Starlink has in space isn’t the only thing it has going for it. The satellites are much different than other satellites already in orbit. Starlink has put most of their satellites in much lower orbit. Starlink Satellites operate around 300 miles above earth, this is more than 60 times closer than traditional satellite internet. This low orbit allows faster download speeds and lower ping than other options. That paired with the size of the constellation allows for users to be connected to optimal satellites for them most of the time. Starlink satellites also produce a different kind of frequency due to their low altitude. The different kind of frequency allows for better penetration through bad weather conditions which traditional satellites struggle with sometimes. These advantages help starlink to provide low-latency and high-speed connections to more rural areas and can be used to allow people that don’t have options like cable to do intense internet tasks like online gaming and video conferencing. The size of the constellation also helps deal with another problem, providing internet to countries that do not have it around the world.

## Real World Application
In early 2022 a lot of infrastructure in Ukraine had been destroyed from the ongoing war with Russia. Starlink activated their service in Ukraine and sent them the equipment and allowed for Ukraine to use their service for free in their current crisis, restoring communication within the country and to the rest of the world. It is speculated that Starlink may be able to be used in the future in countries where free speech is limited by their government as the restricting governments wouldn’t be able to monitor citizens' internet traffic as easily if they were using Starlink.
Starlink has been a game changer for me and some of the people living around me. You would think that infrastructure in the United States would have progressed to the point that the internet options slightly out in the country surrounding cities would still be decent internet compared to in the city, but it is still a ways off. In my area local internet companies buy up contracts from the state government that are to help bring rural internet closer, but the local companies do little to upgrade their equipment and monopolize the internet options in the area. This allows them to charge $99 a month for 15 Mbps download speeds and 3 Mbps upload speeds. These are quite slow compared to the internet you would get with cable. Additionally, these rural internet providers have little incentive to provide even what their advertised speeds are because you have no other option. As of writing this I have the package I listed above and I am only getting 3.28 Mbps download and 1.51 Mbps upload speeds. Starlink advertises download speeds between 25 and 220 Mbps with most of its users experiencing speeds over 100 Mbps.

## Drawbacks and Concerns
There are some concerns for the future of starlink though. Ever since Starlink applied for a large number of satellites, astronomers around the world have been starkly against it. Astronomers build facilities far away from cities to get the least light pollution they can, to observe space. Starlink satellites are somewhat reflective, and have caused quite a commotion due to how many are up there and astronomers are concerned that it will ruin their research. On top of astronomers not liking it, environmental groups are also not liking it. Due to the number of satellites planned to go into orbit and the fact that people can already see some of them up there when they are looking up, they are concerned that Starlink will ruin the night sky and have begun petitioning governments around the world to regulate the area around the earth more and put a stop to the Starlink constellation.

## Future of Starlink
As I said earlier in the blog, Starlink is planning on continued expansion to provide internet globally and even cell phone service globally. With the potential 42,000 satellites they would be able to provide higher speeds and anyone on Earth could connect. It will have hurdles though along the way. Regulations from international groups are sure to come, especially with Elon Musk being one of the leaders of SpaceX, the company operating Starlink. Those could stunt the growth or even shut down Starlink depending on how heavy handed the regulations end up being.

## Starlink Compared to Other Internet Services
Let's look at Starlink compared to some other satellite internet options. As I said before Starlink’s service is $120 a month with download speeds around 100Mbps. It also boasts unlimited data within that cost. The other two satellite internet service providers we will be looking at are HughesNet and Viasat and I will be looking at plans that are closest to Starlink’s $120 a month. I’ll start with HughesNet. HughesNet’s top package is for $149 a month with download speeds of 25Mbps. Additionally Hughesnet had a data cap of 200GB of data for this plan. Next, Viasat offers a plan for $149 a month with download speeds of up to 75Mbps. This Viasat plan offers that speed for the first 150GB of data then it will slow down for the rest of the month. After looking over these plans it's pretty simple to see that Starlink is hands down better than these other options. These other companies have been the only option for very rural households for years and might have become complacent with their speeds and data caps.

## Conclusion
Starlink is definitely making waves. From its competitive pricing and speeds, to its accessibility anywhere it is definitely an emerging technology to watch in the coming years. With how much infrastructure needs to catch up with current technology globally I think this company is making huge
