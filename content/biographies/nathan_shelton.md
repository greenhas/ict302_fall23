# Past & Present Me 
Hello, my name is Nathan Shelton, I am a senior at the Univeristy of Kentucky studying Information Communication Technology. I come from a smaller town in Kentucky called Grayson County. GC has about 33,000 people and UKY has roughly the same amount of students! I transferred from a technical college in Elizabethtown Kentucky where I really developed a passion for Information Systems and Cybersecurity so I decided to pursue it at a higher level. Outside of my studies, I love to exercise. Back home in GC I worked at a gym while attending school, where I cultivated a passion for fitness and helping others. You can learn more about [the gym](https://www.made4morefitness.com/) and [Grayson County](https://www.graysoncountyky.gov/) here.

# Future Me
I have a passion for security, especially laws and regulations, cybercrime, and geopolitical issues regarding cybersecurity. My ultimate dream would be my own cybersecurity company contracted out by businesses to help them meet their cybersecurity needs. In terms of my goals within a career, nothing is more important to me than helping people make sure their data remains their data and stays secure from outside threats and attacks. I will graduate in 2024 and I look forward to pursuing a career and developing skills that will help me reach my ultimate goals.
