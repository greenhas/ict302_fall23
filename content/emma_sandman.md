# About Me
I am an Information Communication Technology major with minors in Animal Science and Spanish and am set to graduate in December 2023. I am originally from Louisville, KY, but moved to Lexington to attend the University of Kentucky. In my free time, I like to play relaxing video games and watch TV. I am also currently learning to crochet!

# Work Experience
I was originally on a pre-vet track before switching to ICT. I worked at a vet clinic in Louisville for six years during that time. After switching to ICT and finding my interests, I began working with the University of Kentucky ITS as a Cybersecurity/GRC Analyst intern and am still working with them. I have also been working part time at the Singletary Center ticket office for the past two years.
