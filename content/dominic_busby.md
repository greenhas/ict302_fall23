## About Me
Hello! I am Dominic Busby, a sophomore at the University of Kentucky studying Information Communication Technology (ICT). A little bit more about me, I enjoy watching and playing sports (Go Cats!) as well as spending time with my friends. I am the treasurer of the Universityâ€™s club frisbee team, and I believe we have the potential to make some noise this year. I also recently joined the cards club and have had fun learning new games and meeting new people. Outside of these, I am more than likely enjoying some time to myself, which I value heavily.



## About the Blog
This blog acts as a live, hands-on way for me to learn about ICT concepts. Throughout the rest of this semester, you will see this blog being updated with more posts, mainly class assignments, that will hopefully show my progress working with content management systems and human relations. If all goes correctly, I will learn a lot of information that I will take with me in my future profession, whatever that may be.

Overall, I am looking forward to what the rest of the semester holds, and I hope this blog is as entertaining for you, if not more, as it will be for me.
