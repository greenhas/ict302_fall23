# Introduction
Hello all! My name is Levi and I wanted to start this introduction with the idea that I am a very easy-going and down-to-earth person. I really enjoy outdoor activities that make me appreciate the world around me. I believe that is extremely important to take time for yourself and go out and enjoy what life has to offer. 
I am originally from Bardstown, KY, and moved up to Lexington, KY at the start of 2021. I go to the University of Kentucky and, at the time of writing, am a third-year ICT major. I have had a wonderful time meeting new people and achieving short-term goals within myself as I progress through college. I hope to be of some great use to my colleagues as we progress on our website and transition into more independent blog posts. 

# Network/Experience
On the more professional side of things, I have moved around from job to job since my first when I was 16. I have handled all kinds of positions including retail, help-desk, business analytics, and culinary service. Feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile linked below.

Thank you for reading my quick bio. I look forward to working with everyone and hope to see you again!
